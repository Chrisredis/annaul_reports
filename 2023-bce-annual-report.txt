Our approach to integrated˚reporting 
Since ˆˇˇ˛, BCE has bee n publis hing a Corpor a te Re sponsibility Report

Explanatio n of certain climat e-re lat ed terms,
metrics and targets 
G reenhouse gas (G H G) e m issions 
T he Intergovernmenta l Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) de˙nes GHG 
as gases in the atmosphere that absorb and emit radiation at sp eci˙c 
wavelengths. This causes an increase in t emperature also known 
as the greenhouse effect. T he main GHGs are carbon dioxide (CO

), 
m e than e (CH

) and nitrous ox ide (N

O), b u t th ere are oth er GH Gs, 
such as su lphu r hexauoride (SF

), hydrouorocarbons (HFC), and 
p eruor ocarb ons (PFCs). T he commonly used unit to meas ure GHG 
emissions is tonnes of CO

 equivalent (tCO

e). To calculate the GHG 
e m issions in tCO˜e, t he individual Global War m ing Pote ntial (GWP) 
of GHG must be considered. All GHGs have di f ferent characteristics 
t hat g ive t hem a spec i˙c lifetime in t he atmosphere and radiation 
absorption pr op erties. T he GWP examines these characteristics for 
the emission of a unit of each gas and compares it to the emission of 
a unit of CO

. T he larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the 
Earth compared to CO

 within the same timeframe. The IPCC pr ovides 
GWP values that are used ac r oss countries and industries in order to 
have a uni˙ed factor for GHG emissions accounting and comparison. 
Scopeˆ˝, ˜ an d ˛ GH G e missions 
Scope ˆ emissions ar e dir ect GHG emissions from sou r ce s tha t are 
con t roll ed by Bell. Scope ˜ emissions ar e indir ect GHG emissions 
associa ted with the consump tion o f pu r ch ased el ectricity, hea ting/ 
cooling and steam r equir ed by Bell™s activitie s. Scope ˆ and ˜ e missions 
are sometimes collectively referred to in this report as ﬁopera tional 
emissionsﬂ. Scope ˛ emissions ar e all indir ect emissions (not incl uded 
in scope˝˜) tha t occu r in ou r value chain, including both upstr eam 
and downstream emissions. 
By de˙nition, GHG emissions from scope ˛ (upstream and downstream 
indirect emissions) occur from sources owned or cont rolled by othe r 
entities in Bell™s value chain (such as our suppliers, e mp loyees and 
cust omer s). As a resul t, measuring scope ˛ e m issions is more complex 
t h an measuring scope ˆ and scope ˜ emissions, for which we are able to 
obtain prima ry data (such as litres of fuel consu med with in our ve h icle 
eet and k ilowatt-h ours of electricity consu med wit hin our buildings). 
For scope ˛ categories for wh ich prim a ry data is not available, we h ave 
to rel y on seconda ry data (such as ˙n anc ial data and ind ustry-average 
data from published databases). These data collection cha llenges 
cont ribute t o u nce rtainty in scope ˛ emissions measurement. 
Carbon abatement ratio 
Many Bell technological solutions enabl e o u r custome rs t o r educe 
their GHG emissions by op timizing tr ansport, ener gy use and 
asset oper a tions. Audio, video and web confer e ncing, tel eworking, 
cloud computing, e-billing, e-learning, energy man agement, eet 
managemen t and tank monit oring ar e some exampl e s. To˝understand 
the carbon ab a tement imp act o f our sol utions we have worked 
with Groupe AGECO, a third-p arty consu ltan t with expertise in GHG 
emissions quan ti˙ca tion, to devel op a methodology th a t e stima te s 
the carbon r eduction cap a city o f our products and service s used 
by o u r customers. The se estima ted bene˙ts ar e cal cu lated using 
the carbon ab a temen t r a tio, which r epr e se n ts the GHG emissions 

e stim a ted to have been avoi ded by Bell™s clients throug h the use o f 
ou r technol ogical solutions in comp arison to ou r own oper ational 
(scope˝ˆ and ˜) GHG emissions. To do so, GHG emissions ar e e stima ted 
in a busine ss-as-usual case wher e carbon r eduction technol ogy 
is not used comp ar ed to the case wher e Bell™s sol utions ar e used. 
The avoided GHG emissions corr e s pond to the differ ence betwee n 
the emissions e stima ted t o h ave been gener a ted in a busine ss-as
usual case comp ar ed to the case wher e Bell™s technol ogical solutions 
ar e used. The e missions gener ated by Bell in providing sol utions to 
customers ar e not deducted from the total carbon ab a teme n t o f 
solutions, but ar e included in ou r oper ational emissions. Only the 
bene˙ts r e su lting from technologie s depl o yed to Bell™s clien ts ar e 
consider ed, i.e., environ men tal bene˙ts associa ted with sol utions

Science-based targets 
Science-b ased tar gets provide a cl earl y-de˙ned p athway for

imp a cts o f climate change. Tar gets ar e consider ed ‚science-b ased™ if 
they ar e in line with wha t the la te st clim a te science deems nece ssary

ˆ.°C above pr e-industrial levels. The Science Based Tar gets initia tive 
(SBTi) brings together a team o f experts to provide comp anie s with

The S BTi has approved ou r three science-b ased tar gets in ˜˚˜˜:

Our sc ience -based t a rgets may need to be further adjus ted in t he

(e.g., business acquisitions/divestitures). 
N et  zero  target 
BCE™s carbo n neu trality is different than, and independent of, the SBT i™s 
ne t zero targe t. Ne t zero refers to the state in which an o rganizatio n

The achieveme n t o f o u r carbon neut r ality tar get (which include s

The˝CRTC decision to mandate access to Bell™s ˙ bre networ k 
in˝Québec and Onta rio is already hav ing an impact on our future

undergoes signi˙cant upheaval. 
Mov ing forwa rd, we will sh if t our focus away from h ighly-regulated

GRI ˜-˜ , ˚-˛, ˚-˜, ˚-˚ 
A key aspect o f stakeholder engagement is establishing mechanisms 
throug h which we can cap tu r e key in ternal and external stakehol der 
opinions and input to support the mapping o f priorities and 
decision-mak ing. 
In ˜˚˜˛, we refr e s hed ou r la te st corpor a te r e s ponsibility priority 
assessmen t, conducted in ˜˚˜ˆ, by su rveying stakehol ders for their 
opinion on the importance o f corpor a te r e s ponsibility topics with the 
gr ea te st poten tial inuence on BCE™s en terprise value, on society, and 
on the environmen t. The stakeholders included customers o f ea ch o f 
ou r service line s, team mem be rs r epr e sen ting various geogr aphie s 
and l evels throug ho ut BCE, investors, supplier s, governmen tal groups, 
non-pro˙t or ganiza tions, l ocal and Indigenous com munity p artners, 
and aca demic institutions. To iden tify the se stakehol de rs, we foll owed 
the guideline s and standard s o f the GRI, as fu rther o utlined in the 
complemen tary r eport Ou r corpor ate r e sponsibility approa ch. This 
su rvey is just one way in which we engage ou r stakehol der s on an 
an nual b asis. 
The r esu lts of the survey demonstr a ted tha t o u r value cr ea ti on 
model and o u r Bell for Better initia tive s ar e aligned with the prioritie s 
iden ti˙ed by ou r stakeh ol ders, as seen in the tabl e bel ow. We h ave 
fu rther developed ou r discl osu r e s on busine ss ethics and ethical 
media pra ctices in response to stakehol der in terest toward these 
topics. Additionally, this assessment allowed us to identify an 
emerging priority for stakeholders: biodiversity and ecosystems, 
which will be fu rther consider ed in the years to come. We plan to 
r epea t this exer cise in the futu r e to con tinue evaluating emer ging 
tr end s tha t cr ea te value for Bell as well as for society and the

Our corporate responsibility approach supports our corporate 
strategy and policies throughout the organization. Through

continuous network investment and innovation. 
Since the beginning of ˜˚˜˚ throu gh to the end of ˜˚˜˛ a s part of its

To do so, GHG emissions ar e e stima ted in a busine ss-as-usual case 
wher e technol ogy is not used comp ar ed t o the case wher e Bell™s

Strategy 
At BCE, we believe comp anie s a cross all sect ors must take a ction and seek to r educe and neutr alize their carbon foot print. This coll ective 
effort is needed to h ol d gl ob al warming t o well bel ow ˜°C , and pr efer ably limit it to ˆ.°C above pre-industrial (ˆ˚Œˆˇ˚˚) l evels. 
Beyond r ed ucing GHG emissions, Bell con tinue s to enhance and pr ep ar e its a dapta tion measu r e s t o face the imp acts of clima te ch ange by 
incr easing corpor a te clima te r e silie ncy. Tha t™s why we asse ss o u r climate-r elated ris k s and opportunitie s and their imp acts on o u r businesse s, 
str ategy, ˙nancial plan ning and over all r e silience. 
In align ment with the TCFD r ecom menda tions, we ca tegorize clima te-rela ted ris ks in t o tr ansition and physical ris ks, and iden tify clim a te-
r e l a
ted tr ansition opportunities. Tr ansition ris ks ar e associa ted with the tr ansition to a l ower-carbon economy. This may include ext ensive 
r egu la tory, technology, and market change s needed to addr e ss mitiga tion and adap ta tion r equiremen ts r ela ted t o climate change. P hysical 
ris ks ar e associa ted with the physical imp a cts from a changing clima te and can either be even t-driven (acute) or l onger- term s hifts (chronic) 
in clima te p a tter ns. For the pu rpose o f discl osu r e s r ecommended by the TCFD, we have focused on seven ma in ris ks, and ˙ve opportunitie s.

Global sci enti˙c evidence suggests that climate chan ge will inc rease both the frequency and severi ty of

These could have a destructive impact o n our communications network infrastruct ure an d in turn a ffect our

safe harbour provisions of applicable Canadian securities laws and of 
the United States (U.S.) 
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of ˚˛˛˝
. 
Unless otherwise indicated by us, forward-looking statements in this 
MD&A describe our expectations as at March˝,˝˜˚˜ and, accordingly, 
are subject to change after that date. Except as may be required by 
applicable securities laws, we do not undertake any obligation to update 
or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new 
information, future events or otherwise. 
Forward-looking statements, by their very nature, are subject to inherent 
risks and uncertainties and are based on several assumptions, both 
general and speci˙c, which give rise to the possibility that actual results 
or events could differ materially from our expectations expressed in, 
or implied by, such forward-looking statements and that our business 
outlook, objectives, plans and strategic priorities may not be achieved. 
These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events, 
and we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking 
statements. Forward-looking statements are presented in this MD& A 
for the purpose of assisting investors and others in understanding 
our objectives, strategic priorities and business outlook as well as our 
anticipated operating environment. Readers are cautioned, however, 
that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. 
We have made certain economic, market, operational and other 
assumptions in preparing the forward-looking statements contained in 
this MD&A, and, in particular, but without limitation, the forward-looking 
statements contained in the previously mentioned sections of this 
MD&A. These assumptions include, without limitation, the assumptions 
described in the various sub-sections of this MD&A entitled 
Assumptions
, 
which sub-sections are incorporated by reference in this cautionary 
statement. Subject to various factors, we believe that our assumptions 
were reasonable at March˝, ˜˚˜. If our assumptions turn out to be 
inaccurate, actual results or events could be materially different from 
what we expect. 
Important risk factors that could cause actual results or events to differ 
materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the previously-
mentioned forward-looking statements and other forward-looking 
statements contained in this MD& A, include, but are not limited to: the 
negative effect of adverse economic conditions, including a potential 
recession, elevated ination, high interest rates and ˙nancial and capital 
market volatility, and the resulting negative impact on business and

customer spending and the demand for our products and services; 
the negative effect of adverse conditions associated with geopolitical 
events; regulatory initiatives, proceedings and decisions, government 
consultations and government positions that negatively affect us 
and inuence our business including, without limitation, concerning 
mandatory access to networks, spectrum auctions, the imposition 
of consumer-related codes of conduct, approval of acquisitions, 
broadcast and spectrum licensing, foreign ownership requirements, 
privacy and cybersecurity obligations and control of copyright piracy; 
the inability to implement enhanced compliance frameworks and to 
comply with legal and regulatory obligations; unfavourable resolution 
of legal proceedings; the intensity of competitive activity and the failure 
to effectively respond to evolving competitive dynamics; the level of 
technological substitution and the presence of alternative service 
providers contributing to disruptions and disintermediation in each 
of our business segments; changing customer behaviour and the 
expansion of cloud-based, over-the-top (
OT T
)
 and other alternative 
solutions; advertising market pressures from economic conditions, 
fragmentation and non-traditional/global digital services; rising content 
costs and challenges in our ability to acquire or develop key content; 
high Canadian Internet and smartphone penetration; the failure to 
evolve and transform our networks, systems and operations using next-
generation technologies while lowering our cost structure, including the 
failure to transition from a traditional telecommunications company 
to a tech services and digital media company and meet customer 
expectations of product and service experience; the inability to drive a 
positive customer experience; the inability to protect our physical and 
non-physical assets from events such as information security attacks, 
unauthorized access or entry, ˙re and natural disasters; the failure to 
implement an effective data governance framework; the failure to attract, 
develop and retain a diverse and talented team capable of furthering 
our strategic imperatives and high-tech transformation; the potential 
deterioration in employee morale and engagement resulting from staff 
reductions, cost reductions or reorganizations and the de-prioritization 
of transformation initiatives due to staff reductions, cost reductions or 
reorganizations; the failure to adequately manage health and safety 
concerns; labour disruptions and shortages; the risk that we may need 
to incur signi˙cant capital expenditures to provide additional capacity 
and reduce network congestion; service interruptions or outages due to 
network failures or slowdowns; events affecting the functionality of, and 
our ability to protect, test, maintain, replace and upgrade, our networks, 
information technology (IT) systems, equipment and other facilities; 
the failure by other telecommunications carriers on which we rely to 
provide services to complete planned and suf˙cient testing, maintenance, 
replacement or upgrade of their networks, equipment and other facilities, 
which could disrupt our operations including through network or other 
infrastructure failures; the complexity of our operations and IT systems 
and the failure to implement or maintain highly effective processes and 
IT systems; in-orbit and other operational risks to which the satellites 
used to provide our satellite television (
TV
)
 services are subject; the 
inability to access adequate sources of capital and generate suf˙cient 
cash ows from operating activities to meet our cash requirements, 
fund capital expenditures and provide for planned growth; uncertainty 
as to whether dividends will be declared or the dividend on common 
shares will be increased by BCE™s board of directors; the failure to 
reduce costs and adequately assess investment priorities, as well as 
unexpected increases in costs; the inability to manage various credit , 
liquidity and market risks; the failure to evolve practices to effectively 
monitor and control fraudulent activities; new or higher taxes due to 
new tax laws or changes thereto or in the interpretation thereof, and the 
inability to predict the outcome of government audits; the impact on our 
˙nancial statements and estimates from a number of factors; pension 
obligation volatility and increased contributions to post-employment 
bene˙t plans; our dependence on third-party suppliers, outsourcers 

and consultants to provide an uninterrupted supply of the products 
and services we need; the failure of our vendor selection, governance 
and oversight processes, including our management of supplier risk in 
the areas of security, data governance and responsible procurement; 
the quality of our products and services and the extent to which they 
may be subject to defects or fail to comply with applicable government 
regulations and standards; reputational risks and the inability to 
meaningfully integrate ESG considerations into our business strategy 
and operations; the failure to take appropriate actions to adapt to 
current and emerging environmental impacts, including climate change; 
pandemics, epidemics and other health risks, including health concerns 
about radio frequency emissions from wireless communications devices 
and equipment; the inability to adequately manage social issues; the 
failure to develop and implement suf˙cient corporate governance 
practices; the adverse impact of various internal and external factors 
on our ability to achieve our ESG targets including, without limitation, 
those related to GHG emissions reduction and DEIB
. 
These and other risk factors that could cause actual results or events 
to differ materially from our expectations expressed in, or implied by, 
our forward-looking statements are discussed in this MD& A and, in 
particular, in section ˇ, 
Business risks
 of this MD&A. 
Forward-looking statements contained in this MD&A for periods 
beyond˝˜˚˜ involve longer-term assumptions and estimates than 
forward-looking statements for˝˜˚˜ and are consequent ly subject 
to greater uncertainty. Forward-looking statements for periods 
beyond˝˜˚˜ further assume, unless otherwise indicated, that the 
risks described above and in section ˇ, 
Business risks
 of this MD&A will 
remain substantially unchanged during such periods. 
We caution readers that the risk factors described above and in the 
previously-mentioned section and in other sections of this MD& A are 
not the only ones that could affect us. Additional risks and uncertainties 
not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial 
may also have a material adverse effect on our business, ˙nancial 
condition, liquidity, ˙nancial results or reputation. We regularly consider 
potential acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, business combinations, 
investments, monetizations, joint ventures and other transactions, 
some of which may be signi˙cant . Except as otherwise indicated by 
us, forward-looking statements do not reect the potential impact 
of any such transactions or of special items that may be announced 

or that may occur after March˝, ˜˚˜. The ˙nancial impact of these 
transactions and special items can be complex and depends on facts 
particular to each of them. We therefore cannot describe the expected 
impact in a meaningful way, or in the same way we present known 
risks affecting our business.

ˆ Overview 
 
In ˜˚˜˜, we began modifying our internal and external reporting 
processes to align with organizational changes that were made 
to reect an increasing strategic focus on multiproduct sales, the 
continually increasing technological convergence of our wireless and 
wireline telecommunications infrastructure and operations driven by 
the deployment of our Fifth Generation (G) and ˙bre networks, and 
our digital transformation. These factors have made it increasingly 
dif˙cult to distinguish between our wireless and wireline operations 
and resulted in changes in Qˆ˝˜˚˜˛˝to the ˙nancial information that is 
regularly provided to our chief operating decision maker to measure 
performance and allocate resources. 
Effective with our Qˆ˝˜˚˜˛˝results, our previous Bell Wireless and Bell 
Wireline operating segments were combined to form a single reporting 
segment called Bell Communication and Technology Services (Bell CTS). 
Bell Media remains a distinct reportable segment and is unaffected. As 
a result of our reporting changes, prior periods have been restated for 
comparative purposes. 
ˆ.ˆIntroduction 
 
At a glance 
BCE is Canada™s largest communications company
 

(1) 
 
Based on total revenue and total combined customer connections. 
, providing 
residential, business and wholesale customers with a wide range of 
solutions for all their communications needs. BCE™s shares are publicly 
traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and on the New York Stock 
Exchange (TSX, NYSE: BCE). 
Our results are reported in two segments: Bell CTS and Bell Media. 
Bell CTS provides a wide range of communication products and services 
to consumers, businesses and government customers across Canada. 
Wireless products and services include mobile data and voice plans and 
devices and are available nationally. Wireline products and services

communication services and products, which are available to our 
residential, small and medium-sized business and large enterprise 
customers primarily in Ontario, Québec, the At lantic provinces and 
Manitoba, while satellite TV service and connectivity to business 
customers are available nationally across Canada. In addition, this 
segment includes our wholesale business, which buys and sells local 
telephone, long distance, data and other services from or to resellers 
and other carriers, as well as the results of operations of our national 
consumer electronics retailer, The Source (Bell) Electronics˝Inc. (The 
Source). Subsequent to year end, Bell Canada announced a strategic 
partnership with Best Buy Canada to operate ˆ˝The Source consumer 
electronics retail stores in Canada, which will be rebranded as Best 
Buy Express and offer the latest in consumer electronics from Best Buy 
along with exclusive telecommunications services from Bell. In addition, 
Bell will wind down The Source head of˙ce and back of˙ce operations,

Our purpose 
BCE™s purpose is to advance how Canadians connect with each other and the world. Our strategy builds on our longstanding strengths in networks, 
service innovation and content creation, and positions the company for continued growth and innovation leadership. Our primary business 
objectives are to grow our subscriber base pro˙tably and to maximize revenues, operating pro˙t, free cash ow and return on invested capital 
by further enhancing our position as the foremost provider in Canada of comprehensive communications services to residential, business and 
wholesale customers, and as Canada™s leading content creation company. We seek to take advantage of opportunities to leverage our networks, 
infrastructure, sales channels, and brand and marketing resources across our various lines of business to create value for our customers and 
other stakeholders. 
Our strategy is centred on our disciplined focus and execution of six strategic imperatives that position us to deliver continued success in a 
fast-changing communications marketplace. The six strategic imperatives that underlie BCE™s business plan are: 
Bell™s 
 
 
six strategic
 
imperative s 
Build the
 
 
best networks 
Drive growth with 
innovative services 
Deliver the most 
 
 
compelling content 
Champion 
customer experience 
Operate with agility 
 
 
and cost ef˙ciency 
Engage and invest in 
 
our people and create 
 
a˝sustainable future 
 
We have begun our journey to modernize from a traditional 
telecommunications company (telco) to a technology services and 
digital media company (collectively referred to as techco). 
Innovation 
is driving customer expectations for enhanced user experiences, 
improved customer service, and faster market responses, all of which 
are improved by our transformation to a techco. Our evolution to a 
techco takes a customer-˙rst approach and speci˙cally sets out to 
deliver incremental value to our customers: 
Ł 
Ability for customers to enjoy our products, services, and content on 
any device in any location 
Ł 
Enable customers to be served on their timeline through simple sales 
and support interactions across the channel of their choosing (e.g., 
online, call centre, store) 
Ł 
Access to new and better products, services and solutions on an
accelerated basis tailored to meet customers™ evolving needs and 
expectations 
To support and accelerate this evolution, we launched a multi-year 
operational transformation project to modernize our operations, increase 
productivity, build tech talent and materially right-size our cost base. 
Our alignment to the International Integrate d Reporting Framework 
Following the principles of the International Integrated Reporting Framework (<IR> Framework)
,
 now part of the International Financial Reporting 
Standards Foundation, Bell released, concurrent ly with this MD& A, an Integrated Annual Report which contains a strategic overview out lining 
our sustainable value creation process. This strategic overview discloses how we seek to generate sustainable value for our stakeholders˝as 
the result of our business operations, guided by our strategic imperatives and use of capitals. Our capitals are outlined below and serve 
as˝inputs that are transformed through our business strategy and strategic imperatives resulting in outcomes that seek to create value for our 
stakeholders over time.

Re duction in capital expenditures and ˜ bre expansion 
Further to the CRTC decision of November˝,˝˜˚˜˛ that imposed an interim aggregated access to FT TP facilities obligation, Bell announced its 
intention to reduce capital expenditures by over $ˆ˝billion 
over 
˜˚˜ and ˜˚˜ combined, including a minimum of $˚˚˝million in ˜˚˜, that the 
company had planned to invest in bringing high-speed ˙bre Internet to hundreds of thousands of additional homes and businesses in rural, 
suburban and urban communities. This reduction is in addition to Bell investing $ˆ˚˝million less than planned in˝
Q 
˜˚˜˛ as a result of the CRTC™s 
decision. Prior to the decision, Bell™s near-term plan was to build high-speed ˙bre to ˇ˝million locations by the end of ˜˚˜. As a direct result of 
federal government policies and the CRTC™s decision that discourages network investment , Bell is slowing the pace of ˙bre footprint expansion 

to a near-term target of .˛ million locations by the end of ˜˚˜ and capping ˙bre speeds at ˛˝Gbps.

Wo rkfo rce r es tructuring 
In light of an operating environment that is being reshaped by increasingly unsupportive federal government 
policies 
and regulatory decisions, 
an economy with high interest rates and continued ination, increasing competition, and evolving consumer preferences, Bell is taking action to 
lower its cost structure and align costs to the revenue potential of each business segment . This includes Bell™s largest workforce restructuring 
initiative in nearly ˛˚˝years, that will result in the reduction of our workforce by approximately ,˚˚˝positions, or ˇ% of all BCE employees 
in ˜˚˜. These workforce reductions are expected to yield in-year cost savings of $ˆ˚˝
million 
to $˜˚˚˝million for ˜˚˜, or $˜˚˝million on an 
annualized basis. Severance payments related to the restructuring initiative could amount to up to approximately $˚˚ million. 
Acquisition of ˙˝˝ MHz wireless spectrum 
Bell secured additional mid-band spectrum licen

™s˝˛˚˚ MHz spectrum 
auction completed in November˝˜˚˜˛, to continue bringing fast and reliable G+ wireless service to more people and businesses across Canada. 
Bellsecuredˇ˛ˇ˝licences covering
 ˆ.˝billion MHz-Pop of˝˛˚˚ MHz spectrum for $ˆ˝million. This acquisition complements Bell™s existing˝˛˚˚ 
MHz spectrum holdings, providing the company with ˆ˚˚˝MHz of˝˛˚˚ MHz and˝˛˚˚ MHz cross-band spectrum across approximately ˇˇ% 
of Canada™s population. Bell will have access to an industry-leading ˛.˝billion MHz-Pop of G+ spectrum (combining the˝˛˚˚ MHz and˝˛˚˚ 
MHz spectrum bands), acquired at a total cost of $˜.˝billion, the lowest among national wireless carriers. 
Strategic par tnership with Best Buy Canada 
On January˝ˆ, ˜˚˜, Bell 
announced 
a strategic partnership with Best Buy Canada to operate ˆ˝The Source consumer electronics 
retailstores 
in Canada, which will be rebranded as Best Buy Express. Bell will be the exclusive telecommunications provider, selling wireless and wireline (in

Caution regarding forward-looking statements 
at the 
beginning of this MD&A. 
We seek to deliver shareholder returns through dividend growth. This objective is underpinned by substantial free cash ow generation and a 
strong balance sheet, supporting ongoing capital investment on adv
anced broadband networks and services that are essential to driving the 
long-term growth of our business.

 %Œ% 
of free cash ow 
On February˝, ˜˚˜, we announced a ˛.ˆ%, or ˆ˜˝cents, increase in 
the annualized dividend payable on BCE™s common shares for˝˜˚˜ 
to $˛.ˇˇ˝per share from $˛.˝per share in ˜˚˜˛, starting with the 
quarterly dividend payable on April˝ˆ, ˜˚˜. 
Our objective seek
s
 to achieve dividend growth while maintaining our 
dividend payout ratio within the target policy range of % to % of 
free cash ow and balancing our strategic business priorities. BCE™s 
dividend payout policy, increases in the common share dividend and the 
declaration of dividends are subject to the discretion of the BCE Board of 
Directors (BCE Board)  and, consequently, there can be no guarantee that 
BCE™s dividend policy will be maintained or achieved , that the dividend 
on common shares will be increased or that dividends will be declared. 
As at December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˛, our dividend payout ratio was ˆˆˆ%, compared 
to ˆ˚% at December˝˛ˆ,˝˜˚˜˜, which is higher than our policy range due 
to elevated capital expenditures compared to pre-˜˚˜˚˝annual levels 
as we continued to make generational investments in our networks to 
support the buildout of our ˙bre, G and G+ network infrastructure. 
Although˝a signi˙cant reduction in capital expenditures is planned 
in˝˜˚˜
, due largely to 
government 
policy, they are expected to 
remain 
higher than pre-˜˚˜˚˝annual levels. In addition, free cash ow in˝˜˚˜ 
will be adversely impacted by 
signi˙cantly 
higher severance payments 
related to workforce restructuring initiatives, higher interest paid and 
lower cash from working capital. As a result, BCE™s dividend payout 
ratiowill 
remain above our target policy range in ˜˚˜. 
Executive compensation alignment 
BCE is focused on a pay-for-performance approach for all team 
members, including our executives. In order to attract , motivate and 
retain top talent , the 
company 
offers a competitive total compensation 
package. 
Ł 
Base salary: rewards the scope and responsibilities of a position, with 
target positioning at the median of our comparator group. 
Ł 
Annual incentive: encourages strong performance against yearly
corporate and individual objectives. 
Ł 
Long-term incentive: aligns with long-term interests of shareholders. 
The mix of vehicles awarded under BCE™s long-term incentive plan 
favours the execution of multiple objectives. They are structured 
to 
create sustainable value for shareholders by attracting, motivating 
and retainingthe executiveof˙cers needed todrive the business 
strategy, and rewarding them for delivering on our goal of advancing 
how Canadians connect with each other and the world, through the 
successful execution of our six strategic imperatives. We have strong 
alignment of interest between shareholders and management through 
our equity-based incentive plans.

was negative $˛˜˝million, down 
from negative $˜ million in ˜˚˜˜. The year-over-year decrease was 
primarily attributable to lower cash ows from operating activities of 
$,ˇ˝million, which decreased by $ˆˇ˝million year 
over

due to lower cash from working capital, in part from timing of supplier 
payments, and higher interest paid. These factors were partly offset by 
 
higher adjusted EBITDA and lower contributions to post-employment 
 
bene˙t plans.

stable˝outlooks 
We monitor our capital structure by utilizing a number of measures, 
principally 
net debt leverage ratio and dividend payout ratio. 
At December˝
˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˛, our net debt leverage ratio 
 was ˛.˝ times 
adjusted EBITDA, an increase from ˛.˛˚˝times adjusted EBITDA at 
December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˜, due mostly to ongoing elevated capital expenditures. 
These leverage levels exceeded our internal target range of ˜.˚˝to 
˜.˝times adjusted EBITDA as we have been in a cycle of strategically 
accelerating our pace of capital expenditures to advance our network 
and transformation investment
s
, acquiring wireless spectrum, ˙nancing 
a number of strategic acquisitions and making voluntary pension plan 
funding contributions. As well, our net debt leverage ratio was adversely 
affected by COVID-ˆˇ˝impacts on our business and the adoption of IFRS˝ˆ 
that added $˜.˛˝billion of lease liabilities to net debt 
 on our balance 
sheet on January˝ˆ, ˜˚ˆˇ. Our objective is to see our net debt leverage 
ratio decline over time to be in the range of ˛.˚˝times adjusted EBITDA. 
While currently in excess of this level, our net debt leverage ratio is still 
consistent with a strong balance sheet, ample ˙nancial exibility and 
investment grade credit ratings. 
This new objective is higher than the previous target for our net debt 
leverage ratio, which was established several years ago. Since that 
time, our leverage level has largely exceeded that 
target and yet we 
have maintained adequate ˙nancial exibility through various market 
conditions. Moreover, at the time of setting our previous targets, we had 
sizeable pension funding de˙cits. We currently have sizeable surpluses. 
While pension funding de˙cits and surpluses are not factored into the 
net debt leverage ratio, the de˙cits represented a potential future 
cash funding requirement while the current surpluses allow us to take 
contribution holidays, enhancing our ˙nancial exibility. We believe the 
new objective of ˛.˚˝times adjusted EBITDA is reective of our operational 
size and strength, an optimized cost of capital
,
 and is aligned with the 
expectations of our investors, lenders and other stakeholders. 
BCE™s adjusted EBITDAto adjusted net interest expense ratio 
˘
 at the end 
of ˜˚˜˛ was .ˇ times adjusted EBITDA, which was below our internal 
target of greater than . times adjusted EBITDA due to an increase in 
interest expense in ˜˚˜˛ attributable to higher average debt balances 
and higher interest rates. Given the correlation between this ratio and 
the net debt leverage ratio, we are simplifying our internal targets to 
reect the net debt leverage ratio only and will not report against the 

adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net interest expense ratio target in the 
future. We believe that this ratio is of less relative importance to our 
investors, lenders and other stakeholders as a measure of the strength 
of our capital structure.

Risk gover nance framework 
Board oversight 
BCE™s full Board is entrusted with the responsibility for identifying and 
overseeing the principal risks to which our business is exposed and 
seeking to ensure there are processes in place to effectively identify, 
monitor and manage them. These processes seek to mitigate rather 
than eliminate risk. A risk is the possibility that an event might happen 
in the future that could have a negative effect on our business, ˙nancial 
condition, liquidity, ˙nancial results or reputation. While the Board has 
overall responsibility for risk, the responsibility for certain elements of 
the risk oversight program is delegated to Board committees in order 
to ensure that they are treated with appropriate expertise, attention 
and diligence, with reporting to the Board on a regular basis.

Risk information is reviewed by the Board or the relevant committee 
throughout the year, and business leaders present regular updates on 
the execution of business strategies, risks and mitigation. 
Ł 
The Risk and Pension Fund Committee has oversight responsibility for 
the organization™s risk governance framework, which exists to identify, 
assess, mitigate and report key risks to which BCE is exposed. As part of 
its Charter, the Risk and Pension Fund Committee is tasked with oversight 
of risks relating to business continuity plans, work stoppage and disaster 
recovery plans, regulatory and public policy, information management 
and privacy, information security (including cyber security), physical 
security, fraud, vendor and supply chain management, ESG (including 
climate change), the pension fund, network resiliency and other risks 

as required. The Risk and Pension Fund Committee receives reports

on security matters, including information security (including cyber

security), and on environmental matters, each quarter. 
Ł 
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the integrity of
our ˙nancial statements and related information, management™s
assessment and reporting on the effectiveness of internal controls,

and risk processes as they relate to ˙nancial reporting. 
Ł 
The Management Resources and Compensation Committee
(Compensation Committee) oversees risks relating to compensation, 
succession planning and workplace policies and practices. 
Ł 
The Corporate Governance Committee (Governance Committee)
assists the Board in developing and implementing BCE™s corporate
governance principles and guidelines, identifying individuals quali˙ed to 
become members of the Board, and determining the composition of the 
Board and its committees. The Governance Committee is responsible 
for oversight of our ESG strategy (including climate change strategy 

and climate-related matters, and supply chain labour issues), and

its integration within our overall business strategy, and disclosure.
The Governance Committee is also responsible for oversight of
the company™s policies concerning business conduct , ethics, public

disclosure of material information and AI governance. 
Risk management culture
There is a strong culture of risk management at BCE that is actively
promoted by the Board, the Risk and Pension Fund Committee and the 
President and CEO, at all levels within the organization. It is a part of
how thecompany operates on a day-to-day basis and is woven into 
its structure and operating principles, guiding the implementation of
the organization™s strategic imperatives. 
The President and CEO, selected by the Board, has set his strategic focus 
through the establishment of six strategic imperatives and focuses risk 
management around the factors that could impact the achievement
of those strategic imperatives. While the constant state of change in
the economic environment and the industry creates challenges that
need to be managed, clarity around strategic objectives, performance 
expectations, risk management and integrity in execution ensures
discipline and balance in all aspects of our business. 
Risk management framework
While the Board is responsible for BCE™s risk oversight program,
operational business units are central to the proactive identi˙cation
and management of risk. They are supported by a range of corporate 
support functions that provide independent expertise to reinforce
implementation of risk management approaches in collaboration with 
the operational business units. The Internal Audit function provides a
further element of expertise and assurance, working to provide insight 
and support to the operational business units and corporate support 
functions, while also providing the Audit Committee, and other Board 
committees as required, with an independent perspective on the state 
of risk and control within the organization. Collectively, these elements 
can be thought of as a ﬁthree linesﬂ approach to risk management. 
Although the risk management framework described in this section˝ˆ.˝is 
aligned with industry practices, there can be no assurance that it will 

be suf˙cient to prevent the occurrence of events that could have a 

material adverse effect on our business, ˙nancial condition, liquidity, 
˙nancial results or reputation.

First line Œ operational business units 
The ˙rst line refers to management within our operational business 
units, who are expected to understand their operations in great detail 
and the ˙nancial results that underpin them. There are regular reviews 
of operating performance involving the organization™s executive and 
senior management . The discipline and precision associated with this 
process, coupled with the alignment and focus around performance 
goals, creates a high degree of accountability and transparency in 
support of our risk management practices. 
As risks emerge in the business environment , they are discussed in a 
number of regular forums to share details and explore their relevance 
across the organization. Executive and senior management are integral 
to these activities in driving the identi˙cation, assessment, mitigation 
and reporting of risks at all levels. Formal risk reporting occurs through 
strategic planning sessions, management presentations to the Board 
and formal enterprise risk reporting, which is shared with the Board 

and the Risk and Pension Fund Committee during the year. 
Management is also responsible for maintaining effective internal 
controls and for executing risk and control procedures on a day-to-day 
basis. Each operational business unit develops its own operating controls 
and procedures that ˙t the needs of its unique environment . 
Second line Œ corporate support functions 
BCE is a very large enterprise, with ,ˆ˛˜˝employees as at December˝˛ˆ,

ef˙ciency, scale and consistency. While the ˙rst line is often central to 
identi˙cation and management of business risks, in many instances 
operational management works collaboratively with, and also relies 
on, the corporate functions that make up the second line of support in 
these areas. These corporate functions include Regulatory, Finance, 
Corporate Security, Corporate Risk Management, Legal, Corporate 
Responsibility, Human Resources, Real Estate and Procurement . 
Regulatory function:
 This function is responsible for the regulatory 
portfolio, including an expanding range of obligations set out in new 
privacy and data protection laws being enacted in Canada and around 
the world. BCE has developed, and maintains, an enhanced Data 
Governance Policy that encompasses the protection and appropriate 
use of data across its life cycle. A signi˙cant element of the data 
governance program relies on the Corporate Security activities outlined 
below and these two functions work joint ly with data owners, data 
custodians and other relevant employees to seek to ensure this policy is 
appropriately implemented. We recognize that a strong and consistently 
applied approach to data governance is essential to maintaining the 
social licence necessary to achieve our business objectives. For more 
information on our approach to privacy and data security, refer to 
section ˆ., 
Capitals and our corporate responsibility
, in this MD& A. 
Finance function:
 BCE™s Finance function plays a pivotal role in seeking 
to identify, assess and manage risks through a number of activities, 
which include ˙nancial performance management, external reporting, 
pension management, capital management, and oversight and execution 
practices related to the U.S. 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of˘ˇˇ
 and equivalent 
Canadian securities legislation, including the establishment and 
maintenance of appropriate internal control over ˙nancial reporting. BCE 
has also established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures 
to seek to ensure that the information it publicly discloses, including 
its business risks, is accurately recorded, processed, summarized and

Corporate Security function:
 This function is responsible for all aspects 
of security, which requires a deep understanding of the business, the risk 
environment and the external stakeholder environment. Based on this 
understanding, Corporate Security sets the standards of performance 
required across the organization through security policies and directives 
that de˙ne requirements to protect team members, company assets 
and information. In high and emerging risk areas such as information 
security, Corporate Security leverages its experience and competence 
to develop strategies intended to mitigate the organization™s risks. For 
instance, we have implemented security awareness training, policies 
and directives that seek to mitigate information security threats. We 
further rely on security assessments to identify risks and review projects 
with the objective of ensuring that systems are deployed with the 
appropriate level of control, including access management, vulnerability 
management , security monitoring and testing. We evaluate and seek 
to adapt our security policies and directives designed to protect our 
information and assets in light of the continuously evolving nature 
and sophistication of information security threats. However, given the 
complexity andscale of our business, networkinfrastructure,technology 
and IT support systems, there can be no assurance that the security 
policies and directives that we implement will prevent the occurrence 
of all potential information security breaches. In addition, although 
BCE has contracted an insurance policy covering information security 
risk, there can be no assurance that any insurance we may have will 
cover the costs, damages, liabilities or losses that could result from the 
occurrence of any information security breach. 
Corporate Risk Management function: 
This function works across 
the company to gather information and report on the organization™s 
assessment of its principal risks and the related exposures. Annually, 
senior management participate in a risk survey that provides an 
important reference point in the overall risk assessment process. 
In addition to the activities described above, the second line is also 
critical in building and operating the oversight mechanisms that bring 
focus to relevant areas of risk and reinforce the bridges between the 
˙rst and second lines, thereby seeking to ensure that there is a clear 
understanding of emerging risks, their relevance to the organization 
and the proposed mitigation plans. 
To further coordinate efforts between the ˙rst and second lines, BCE has 
established a Health and Safety, Security, Environment and Compliance 
Oversight Committee (HSSEC Committee). A signi˙cant number of 
BCE™s most senior leaders are members of the HSSEC Committee, 
the purpose of which is to oversee BCE™s strategic security (including 
information security), compliance, environmental, and health and 
safety risks and opportunities. This cross-functional committee seeks 
to ensure that relevant risks are adequately recognized and mitigation 
activities are well integrated and aligned across the organization and 

are supported with suf˙cient resources. The HSSEC Committee also 

mandates the company™s Energy Board, a working group composed 
of business unit employees, including vice-presidents and directors, to 
ensure oversight of our overall energy consumption and costs with the 
objective of minimizing ˙nancial and reputational risks while maximizing 
business opportunities. The Energy Board also oversees the progress 
made towards meeting our GHG emissions reduction and supplier 
engagement targets. In addition, the company™s Climate Resiliency Task 
Force, composed of senior vice-presidents, vice-presidents, directors 
and managers, reports to the HSSEC 
Committee 
and assists in building 
a climate resiliency governance to seek to address the potential impacts 
of climate change in the short and medium terms. 
The company™s Corporate Responsibility 
(CR) 
Board, composed of a 
signi˙cant number of employees at the senior vice-president , vice-
president and director levels, supports the evolution of our corporate 
responsibility strategy. The CR Board has the responsibilities, among 
others, to embed corporate responsibility considerations into corporate 
and business unit strategies, assist in identifying corporate responsibility 
areas for further improvement, establish relevant ESG metrics, respond 
to stakeholders™ concerns, review ESG public disclosures, approve 
procedures seeking to verify the accuracy of publicly disclosed ESG 
information and support various corporate responsibility initiatives. The 
CR Board reports on progress to the HSSEC Committee, the co-chairs 
of which report to the Risk and Pension Fund Committee, Governance 
Committee and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The 
CR Board also reports to the BCE Disclosure and Compliance Committee 
with regards to the public disclosure of ESG information. 
Third line Œ internal audit function 
Internal Audit is a part of the overall management information and 
control system and has the responsibility to act as an independent 
appraisal function. Its purpose is to provide the Audit Committee, 
other Board committees, as required, and management with objective 
evaluations of the company™s risk and control environment, to support 
management in ful˙lling BCE™s strategic imperatives and to maintain 

an audit presence throughout BCE and its subsidiaries.

Since our founding in ˆ˚, Bell has been enabling Canadians to connect with each other and the world. Our approach to corporate responsibility 
is to 
manage 
the company in ways that nurture the social and economic prosperity of our communities while safeguarding the environment . 
Corporat e responsibility underpins our six strategic imperatives 
Corporate responsibility is a fundamental element of each of the six 
strategic imperatives that inform BCE™s policies, decisions and actions. 
As one of Canada™s largest companies, we are driven to continually 
improve our impact and our contribution to society with our network 
deployments, investments in mental health initiatives, environmental 
sustainability and 
an 
engaged workplace. This approach also supports 
our purpose to advance how Canadians connect with each other and 
the world. 
Our corporate responsibility approach is informed by a set of guiding 
principles that support our corporate strategy and policies throughout 
the organization. Through our own internal processes along with 
stakeholder feedback, we have prioritized, and set clear objectives to 
address ESG issues and opportunities, seeking to enhance sustainability 
across BCE. We constant ly measure and report on our progress. Through 
these actions, we strive to drive environmental leadership, achieve a 
diverse and inclusive workplace, lead data governance, and protect 
and build stronger, healthier communities. 
The Board has established clear oversight of our corporate responsibility 
programs and our approach to ESG practices with primary accountability 
at the committee level. The Governance Committee is responsible 
for oversight of our corporate purpose and our ESG strategy and 
disclosure. This includes the integration of ESG within our company 
strategy and monitoring the implementation of ESG programs, goals 
and key initiatives. Moreover, it is responsible for oversight and related 
disclosure of climate-related risks, and for our governance practices 
and policies, including those concerning business conduct and ethics. 
In addition, the Risk and Pension Fund Committee oversees risks that 
could impact our business, such as safety and security, business 
continuity and ESG risks, while the Audit Committee monitors signi˙cant 
ESG issues and approves our risks and assumptions disclosures. The 
Compensation Committee has oversight of human resource issues 
and tracks corporate performance against our ESG targets. Since 
˜˚˜˚, the Compensation Committee has formally added ESG targets 
to the corporate performance metrics within the measures of the 
company™s annual short-term incentive compensation program, the 
Annual Incentive Plan (AIP). In ˜˚˜˜, to reect how ESG is embedded 
into the overall strategy of the business, ESG-related metrics were 
embedded throughout our strategic imperatives score and represent, 
in aggregate, at least ˛˚% of the total strategic imperatives score. The 
strategic imperative score represents ˚% weighting of the Corporate 
Performance Index within the AIP. 
Since ˆˇˇ˛, BCE had been publishing a Corporate Responsibility Report 
detailing our performance in managing 
ESG 
issues. In ˜˚˜˜, for the ˙rst 
time, we presented both our ˙nancial and non-˙nancial performance 
in an Integrated annual report following the principles of the <IR> 
Framework now part of the International Financial Reporting Standards
. 
We believe this approach provides a useful basis for disclosing how we 
seek to create sustained value for our stakeholders over time. An integral 
element of the <IR> Framework are the six pillars, called ﬁcapitalsﬂ (our 
networks, our customers and relationships, our products and services, 
our environment, our people and our ˙nancial resources). We call them 
capitals because they are inputs to value creation.

Our networks 
Our 
networks 
Our networks and services are fundamental to the communities we serve, 
the nation™s economy and Canadian society as a whole. Our networks are 
integral to delivering our wireless, wireline, and broadcasting services. 
We work closely with governments, regulators and our customers to 
maximize these societal bene˙ts. 
Additionally, privacy and information security present both potentially 
signi˙cant risks and opportunities for any business operating in the digital 
economy. They are the subject of an expanding range of obligations, 
including under new privacy and data protection laws being enacted 

in Canada and around the world. Our customers, team members and 

investors increasingly expect us to demonstrate that we collect data 
appropriately, use it for purposes that advance their interests, and 
keep it secure. 
How digital access helps create value 
Advanced communications networks provide access to a broad 
spectrum of everyday activities for all Canadians. Today, Bell™s network 
technologies are a key part of Canada™s ˜ˆst˝century infrastructure. 
Our networks provide an ever-increasing number of consumers and 
businesses of all sizes with greater capabilities and new opportunities 
to connect, build, and grow, while bridging the digital divide. 
Our activities and outcomes 
Bell investments are delivering bene˙ts directly to our customers, 
from providing more consumers with better access to family and 
friends, remote learning and entertainment to enabling businesses 
and communities to operate more ef˙ciently and grow in the digital 
economy. At the same time, by continuing to close the digital divide 
that separate communities, we are also supporting growth among 
suppliers and partners and helping build and drive innovation across 
the Canadian digital ecosystem. 
In ˜˚˜˛, Bell™s capital expenditures were $.˝billion as we continued˝to 
accelerate ˙bre deployments direct ly to homes and businesses and 
G wireless connectivity throughout our footprint. As a direct result of 
these investments, Bell™s pure ˙bre Internet was made available to an 
additional ˛˛,˚˚˚˝homes and businesses by the end of ˜˚˜˛. 
Bell wireless and network technologies are a key part of Canada™s 
˜ˆst˝century infrastructure. Bell™s LTE wireless network reached ˇˇ% of 
Canadians by ˜˚˜˚. Since then we have launched and expanded our 
G network in urban and rural markets, reaching % of all Canadians 
by the end of ˜˚˜˛. 
Investing in network security, capacity and resiliency has helped Bell 
achieve ˇˇ.ˇˇ˜% network reliability in ˜˚˜˛. Our investments provide 
core network architecture, diversity and redundancy Œ including multiple 
transport routes Œ which minimize the risk of major service disruptions. 
We also proactively provide noti˙cations to keep customers informed 
if services are disrupted.

How data governance helps create value 
We recognize that to achieve our purpose of advancing how Canadians 
connect with each other and the world, we must maintain the social 
licence from our customers and all Canadians to collect and use data 
in our operations. A strong and consistent ly applied approach to data 
governance is critical to maintaining that social licence by focusing 
on respecting the privacy of our customers™ data and protecting such 

data against information security threats. Conversely, failure to meet 

customer expectations regarding the appropriate use and protection 

of their data can have negative reputational, business and ˙nancial 

consequences for our company. 
Our activities and outcomes 
Our approach to data governance encompasses the protection and 
appropriate use of data across their life cycle, and we are incorporating 
data governance proactively as a core consideration in all our business 
initiatives and technology decisions. We have a data governance policy 
which covers privacy, information security, data access management 
and records management. All employees are trained on data governance, 
as part of our mandatory biannual code of business conduct training. In 
˜˚˜˛, Bell continued to make signi˙cant investments in people, processes 
and technology in order to seek to protect con˙dential information 
from evolving cybersecurity threats.

How information security governance
helps create value 
Cybersecurity threats give rise to new and emerging standards and 
regulations. We need to be able to identify and address information 
security risks in a timely manner in order to be in a better position to 
protect our market share and reputation, and these efforts align with 
our strategic imperative to champion customer experience, while at the 
same time reducing exposure to cyberattacks. Avoiding data breaches 
can also limit the increase in expenses associated with remediation 
efforts and legal exposures, aligning with our strategic imperative to 

operate with agility and cost ef˙ciency. 
Our activities and outcomes 
We are focused on maintaining the trust that our customers have in us to 
protect their data. To do this, we are implementing prevention, detection, 
and response programs related to security threats. In addition, we are 
helping de˙ne industry security and risk management practices, and 
we are training our team members on data protection. 
In ˜˚˜˛, we have aligned our Information Security program at ˆ˚˚% of 
the ISO/IEC ˜˚˚ˆ˝standard. Starting in ˜˚˜ˆ, we launched our Be Cyber 
Savvy information security training program. This training program 
includes onboarding to our specialized Cyber Awareness platform, 
the conducting of monthly phishing simulations and the completion 
of four baseline courses. Team members must complete these four 
courses within ˆ˜˝months of being onboarded to the program. This 
year, ˇ% of onboarded team members completed baseline training 
by the end of ˜˚˜˛. As we move forward, we believe a combination of 
training, clear messaging, and positive reinforcement when reporting 
a phishing attempt , should lead to year-over-year phishing report 
rate improvement.This year, we observed a ˆ˜% increase in reported 
phishing simulations by trained employees.

Since ˜˚ˆ˚, the Bell Let™s Talk mental health initiative has raised 
awareness and action for Canadian mental health, with a focus on 
helping reduce the stigma around mental illness, improving access 
to care, supporting world-class research and leading by example in 
workplace mental health. Over the last ˆ years, Canadians have taken 
action to create real change by engaging in the world™s largest 
mental 
health conversation, to help create a Canada where everyone can get 
the culturally-appropriate mental health support they need. By ˜˚˜, 
Bell expects to reach its total current commitment of $ˆ million for 
Canadian mental health supports and services. 
How taking action on mental health
helps create value 
Our products and services help communities thrive, and we believe the 
way we invest Œ our time, our money and our passion Œ has a positive 
impact on the communities we serve. Communities also bene˙t from 
the engagement of our team members as they support the causes they 
value deeply. Bell is taking a leading role in helping address the mental 
health crisis in Canada with the Bell Let™s Talk mental health initiative. 
The program encourages Canadians to take action and achieve real 
change in their mental health. 
Our activities and outcomes

Our products and services 
Our˝products 
and services 
Our products and services provide value to Canadians by helping them 
both mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. Our solutions 
enable customers to reduce environmental impacts, improve health 
and safety and better safeguard protected data from growing risks. 
How our products and services contributing
to˚climate change mitigation and adaptation

helps create value 
Bell technologies and services can help our customers reduce energy 
needs, minimize carbon footprints and enhance productivity. Our 
solutions help businesses embrace new ways to communicate, 
collaborate, ensure business continuity and be able to maintain services 
in the event of emergencies and extreme incidents. 
Our activities and outcomes 
Our solutions include: 
Ł 
virtualization and cloud computing which encourage optimal use of
space, power and cooling resources by consolidating servers and

storage and improve business continuity through redundancies in

our network 
Ł 
IoT services which can help optimize asset and eet management

andare effective for smart buildings, smart cities, smart operations 

and smart ˙eldwork applications. Electronic controls coupled with

our communications networks can help communities adapt to rising

dematerialization
, the reduction of the quantities of materials needed

At Bell, we believe it is important to understand the net carbon abatement 
impact of our solutions. To achieve this, we have worked with Groupe 
AGECO, a third-party consultant with expertise in GHG emissions
quanti˙cation, to develop a methodology that uses a carbon abatement 
ratio which estimates the carbon reduction capacity of our products
and services used by our customers. The carbon abatement ratio
represents the GHG emissions estimated to have been avoided by our 
customers through the use of our technological solutions in comparison 
to our own operational (scope ˆ˝and ˜) GHG emissions. To do so, GHG 
emissions are estimated in a business-as-usual case where technology 
is not used compared to the case where Bell™s products are used. The 
avoided GHG emissions correspond to the difference between the
emissions estimated to have been generated in a business-as-usual

case compared to the case where Bell™s technological solutions are
used. The emissions generated by Bell in providing the solutions to
the customers are not deducted from the total carbon abatement of 
solutions, but are included in our operational emissions. Only the bene˙ts 
resulting from technologies deployed to Bell™s clients are considered, 
i.e., environmental bene˙ts associated with solutions implemented
within Bell™s own operations are not included. An example of how the 
calculations were made is provided below:

Our 
environment 
We strive to minimize the negative environmental impacts of our 
operations and to create positive impacts where possible. We also know 
that our team members, our customers, and our investors expect this. 
Taking care of the environment makes good business sense. If we fail to 
take action to reduce our negative impacts on the environment, we risk 
losing our valuable team members and customers to competitors, we 
risk increased costs due to ˙nes or remediation requirements, and we 
risk losing investors, all of which could adversely impact our business. 
We have been implementing and maintaining programs to reduce 
the environmental impact of our operations for more than ˛˚˝years. 
Our Environmental Policy, ˙rst issued in ˆˇˇ˛, reects our team 
members™ values, as well as the expectations of customers, investors 
and society that we regard environmental protection as an integral 
part of doing business that needs to be managed systematically under 
a continuous improvement process. We implemented an environmental 
management system (EMS) to help with this continuous improvement , 
which has been certi˙ed ISO ˆ˚˚ˆ

How addressing climate change
helps create value 
Climate change poses risks to our operating environment and our 
ability to create value. To help mitigate these risks, we aim to reduce 
our energy consumption and GHG emissions while continuing to adapt 
to the impacts of climate change. 
Our activities and outcomes 
We are taking action both to help ˙ght climate change and adapt to its 
consequences. We are adapting by taking action to seek to maintain our 
resiliency in the face of climate change, and are helping our customers 
do the same. To ˙ght climate change, we are focused on reducing our 
energy consumption and GHG emissions, while also helping customers 
reduce theirs. Fostering innovation that helps reduce our carbon footprint 
is part of our culture. On an annual basis, we calculate, monitor and 
publicly report on our energy performance and GHG emissions as part 
of our environmental and energy management systems. Since ˜˚˚˛, 
we report on our climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts 
through the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), a 
pro˙t organization that gathers information on climate-related risks 
and opportunities from organizations worldwide. In ˜˚˜˛, we obtained 
an A- score from the CDP, ranking us in the ﬁLeadership Bandﬂ for the

How circular economy helps create value 
We are improving our circular economy model to focus on solutions 
that detach growth from accelerating raw material consumption in 
order to reduce the environmental impact of our operations. Waste 
reduction is essential to our objective of improving our operational 
ef˙ciency and also aligns with the values and expectations of our team 
members and customers. 
Our activities and outcomes 
Bell has managed waste reduction, reuse and recycling programs 
for more than ˛˚˝years. We have waste reduction goals and strong 
monitoring processes in place that enable us to track and report on our 
activities that generate waste. To manage the waste created from the 
electronic devices we distribute to customers, we have implemented 
effective and accessible e-waste collection programs for the recovery, 
reuse, refurbishment and recycling of customer-facing devices, including 
national take-back programs, drop boxes and mail-in instructions. To 
measure the success of these programs, we had set a goal to collect 
˝million used TV receivers, modems, mobile phones and Wi-Fi pods 
between 
October˝ˆ,˝˜˚˜˚ and September˝˛˚, ˜˚˜˛, which we™ve 
exceeded in˝˜˚˜˛ with the collection of ,˚,˛˜˛˝devices. At Bell, we 
believein leading byexample, andso tocontinue tomanageand reduce 
the waste generated from our own operations, we have the target to 
reach and maintain a ˆ% reduction of total waste sent to land˙ll by 
˜˚˜, from a˝ ˜˚ˆˇ baseline year. We™ve exceeded this target in˝˜˚˜˛ 
bydivertinga 
total of ˆ% waste from land˙ll. Through setting waste 
reduction targets, such as the ones listed above, we are striving to build 
a resilient path to circularity. In ˜˚˜, we will work to set a new target , 
while efforts will continue to further divert waste from land˙ll and keep 
the numbers of electronic devices we recover as a key metric to monitor 
our performance. We are also investing in research and development 
for solutions where current technology does not provide responsible 
waste diversion methods.

How fostering diversity, equity, inclusion
and˚belonging helps create value 
At Bell, we are proud of our focus on fostering a diverse, inclusive, 
equitable and accessible workplace where all team members feel valued, 
respected and supported. We are dedicated to building a workforce 
that reects the diversity of the communities we serve, where every 
team member has the opportunity to reach their full potential. The 
integration of DEIB programs within Bell fosters the innovation and 
creativity of our team members. 
Our activities and outcomes 
Our DEIB strategy is supported by a governance framework that 
includes theDiversity LeadershipCouncil withsenior leaders fromevery 
business unit , business unit committees and employee-led networks, 
including Black Professionals at Bell, Pride at Bell, Diversability at Bell 
and Women at Bell. 
In line with our objective of improving gender diversity, our current 
gender diversity target for the Board is a minimum of ˛% gender 
diverse directors, de˙ned as directors who identify as women and 
directors 
who identify with a gender other than a man or a woman. 
This target was met from its adoption, in ˜˚˜ˆ,  until the appointment 
of Johan Wibergh to the Board on November˝ˆ, ˜˚˜˛, following which 
(and as of December ˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˛) ˛˛% of all directors identi˙ed as women. 
With the increase in the number of directors upon his appointment, the 
Board is temporarily below the target to allow for an orderly transition 
ahead of the retirement
s
 of David F. Denison and Robert C. Simmonds at 
the˝
end of the ˜˚˜ Annual General Shareholder Meeting (the Meeting) 
in May. The target will be met again if all director nominees are elected 
at the Meeting, after which directors identifying as women will represent 
˛

which aim to increase 
the proportion of 
women within executive leadership positions and serving on Canadian 
corporate boards to 
at 
least ˛˚%. In ˜˚˜˜ and ˜˚˜˛, Bell exceeded that 
target 
with ˛˜% women in executive positions but did not achieve Bell™s 
goal of at least ˛% gender diverse executives (vice president level 
and 
above) by 
the 
end of ˜˚˜˛ and in July ˜˚˜˛, we extended 
our
 target 
date to achieve this goal to the end of ˜˚˜. 
Bell continues to take meaningful actions to address the impacts of 
systemic racism experienced by Black, Indigenous and Persons of Colour 
(BIPOC)
. Our goal is to reach at least ˜% BIPOC representation in our 
senior management team by ˜˚˜. As of the end of ˜˚˜˛, we were 
at ˜˛%. We exceeded our target of ˚% BIPOC representation in our 
new graduate and intern hires, achieving % representation in ˜˚˜˛. 
Ongoing partnerships with the Onyx Initiative and the Black Professionals 
in Tech Network are helping drive the recruitment of Black college and 
university students and promote Black talent in technology. Bell Media 
continues to promote greater diversity in Canadian media with the 
HireBIPOC website and the Bell Media Content Diversity Task Force in 
partnership with BIPOC TV & Film. 
Looking ahead, we plan to continue building momentum for our

Our GHG emissions reduction and supplier engagement targets are 
based on a number of assumptions including, without limitation, the 
following principal assumptions: 
Ł 
Our ability to purchase a signi˙cant amount of high-quality credible 
carbon credits and/or renewable energy certi˙cates (RECs)to offset 
or reduce, as applicable, our GHG emissions 
Ł 
The carbon offset resulting from the purchase of carbon credits will 
be permanent and will not be reversed, in whole or in part, prior to

the date of our targets 
Ł 
The successful and timely implementation of various corporate and 

business initiatives to reduce our electricity and fuel consumption,

as well as reduce other direct and indirect GHG emissions enablers 
Ł 
No new corporate initiatives, business acquisitions, business divestitures

Explanation of certain climate-related terms, metrics and targets 
Scope ˇ, ˛˚and ˙˚GHG emissions 
Scope ˆ˝emissions are direct GHG emissions from sources that are 
controlled by Bell. Scope ˜ emissions are indirect GHG emissions 
associated with the consumption of purchased electricity, heating/ 
cooling and steam required by Bell™s activities. Scope ˆ˝and ˜˝emissions 
are sometimes collectively referred to in this MD& A as ﬁoperational 
emissionsﬂ. Scope ˛˝emissions are all indirect emissions (not included 
in scope ˜) that occur in our value chain, including both upstream and 
downstream emissions. 
By de˙nition, GHG emissions from scope ˛˝(upstream and downstream 
indirect emissions) occur from sources owned or controlled by other 
entities in Bell™s value chain (such as our suppliers, employees and 
customers). As a result, measuring scope ˛˝emissions is more complex 
than measuring scope ˆ˝and scope ˜˝emissions, for which we are able to 
obtain primary data (such as litres of fuel consumed within our vehicle 
eet and kilowatt-hours of electricity consumed within our buildings). 
For scope ˛˝categories for which primary data is not available, we have 
to rely on secondary data (such as ˙nancial data and industry-average 
data from published databases). These data collection challenges 
contribute to uncertainty in scope ˛˝emissions measurement . 
Carbon neutrality 
We will measure our carbon neutrality performance based on our 
operational GHG emissions (scope ˆ˝and scope ˜˝emissions in tonnes 
of CO

e) minus GHG emissions offset by carbon credits purchased (in 
tonnes of CO

 e). To be carbon neutral, the total must be equal to zero 
or lower. In order to achieve our target of carbon neutral operations 
starting in ˜˚˜, we expect that we will need to purchase a signi˙cant 
amountofcarbon credits 
to offset our scope ˆ˝and ˜˝GHG emissions 
that will not have been avoided by internal initiatives, in addition to 
RECs 
to reduce our scope ˜˝emissions. In˝˜˚˜˛, our scope ˆ˝and ˜˝emissions 
represented ˆ˜% of our total carbon footprint. Our target for carbon 

neutral operations excludes our scope ˛˝emissions that represented 
% of our carbon footprint in ˜˚˜˛. 
Science-based targets 
Science-based targets provide a clearly-de˙ned pathway for companies 
to reduce GHG emissions, aiming to prevent the worst impacts of climate 
change. Targets are considered ‚science-based™ if they are in line with 
what the latest climate science deems necessary to meet the goals of the 
Paris Agreement Œ limiting global warming to ˆ.°C above pre-industrial 
levels. The SBTi brings together a team of experts to provide companies 
with independent assessment and validation of targets. 
Net zero target 
BCE™s carbon neutrality and science-based targets are different than, 
and independent of, the SBTi™s net zero target. Net zero refers to the 
state in which an organization reduces GHG emissions in its entire 
value chain (i.e., scopes ˆ, ˜˝and ˛˝GHG emissions) to as close to zero as 
possible (with a minimum reduction of at least ˇ˚%) and neutralizes 
 
(1) 
 
According to SBTi, neutralize means that carbon is removed from the atmosphere and permanently stored in geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products. 
any remaining emissions such that its net global GHG emissions balance 
to zero. At the moment , BCE does not have a net zero target .

Business outlo ok a nd as sumptions 
This section contains forward-looking statements, including relating to our projected ˙nancial performance, our anticipated capital expenditures 
and network deployment plans, and our business outlook, objectives, plans and strategic priorities. Refer to the section 
Caution regarding 
forward-looking statements
 at the beginning of this MD& A. 
˛˝˛˘˚out look 
˜˚˜˝will be an important transformation year for BCE. We look to 
maintain operational momentum, while balancing growth with ˙nancial 
performance, as we continue our transition to a tech services and digital 
mediacompany
. Our out look for˝˜˚˜ takes into consideration potential 
recessionary and competitive pricing pressures
,
 as well as the ˙nancial 
impact of our strategic distribution partnership with Best Buy Canada 
that will result in a decrease in largely consumer electronics related 
revenue from our consolidated results. The impact of this partnership on 
BCE™s adjusted EBITDA will not be material given relatively low margins 
for consumer electronics. Our ˜˚˜ out look also reect
s
 the impacts 
of our workforce restructuring and other transformation initiatives 
that 
aim to better position the company for future growth and success. 
Our strategic priorities in˝˜˚˜ centre on: 
Ł 
Accelerating growth investments, including in cloud and security
services, advanced advertising and digital transformation, while
de-emphasizing and reducing spending on highly-regulated and
declining businesses 
Ł 
Maintaining focus on premium mobile phone subscriber acquisition
with increased emphasis on market growth 
Ł 
Leveraging our existing ˙bre footprint, network speed leadership and 
product strength to drive greater cross-sell penetration of Internet

households with wireless 
Ł 
Accelerating our business markets growth in cloud, security and
workow automation solutions 
Ł 
Maintaining our strength in digital media driven by our advanced
advertising capabilities, premium inventory and new distribution
initiatives 
Ł 
Realizing cost savings from our transformation initiatives, including

workforce reductions 
Underpinning our out look for˝˜˚˜ is a stable ˙nancial pro˙le that
reects our sound operating fundamentals and consistent execution in 
a competitive marketplace. Wireless, retail Internet and IPTV subscriber 
base growth, together with promotional offer discipline and the ow-
through of operating cost savings from transformation initiatives,
including a reduced workforce, are projected to drive year-over-year 
growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Direct ly as a result of federal 
government policies and the CRTC™s decision in November ˜˚˜˛ to
mandate wholesale access to Bell™s FTTP network, we plan a signi˙cant 
reduction in capital expenditures that will lead to a slowdown in our
pure ˙bre build and lower spending in highly-regulated businesses.
Despite expected growth in adjusted EBITDA and lower planned capital 
expenditures, a combination of higher severance payments related
to workforce restructuring initiatives, higher interest paid and lower
projected cash from working capital is expected to drive lower free
cash ow. 
Assumptions 
Assumptions about the Canadian economy 
Ł 
Slowing economic growth, given the Bank of Canada™s most recent
estimated growth in Canadian gross domestic product of ˚.% in˝˜˚˜, 
down from ˆ.˚% in ˜˚˜˛ 
Ł 
Easing, but still elevated, consumer price index (CPI) ination as the

effects of past interest rate increases work through the economy 
Ł 
Easing labour market conditions 
Ł 
Muted growth in household spending due to slow labour income
growth, high debt-servicing costs and weak consumer con˙dence 
Ł 
Soft business investment growth due to slow demand and still-elevated 
borrowing costs 
Ł 
Prevailing high interest rates expected to remain at or near current

levels 
Ł 
Population growth resulting from strong immigration 
Ł 
Canadian dollar expected to remain near current levels. Further
movements may be impacted by the degree of strength of the U.S.

dollar, interest rates and changes in commodity prices
.
Market assumptions
Ł 
A higher level of wireline and wireless competition in consumer,
business and wholesale markets 
Ł 
Higher, but slowing, wireless industry penetration 
Ł 
A shrinking data and voice connectivity market as business customers 
migrate to lower-priced telecommunications solutions or alternative 
OT T competitors 
Ł 
The Canadian advertising market is experiencing a slowdown consistent

Principal business risks 
Provided below is a summary description of certain of our principal 
business risks that could have a material adverse effect on all of 
our segments. Certain additional business segment-speci˙c risks 
are reported in section , 
Business segment analysis
. For a detailed 
description of the principal risks relating to our regulatory environment 
and of the other principal business risks that could have a material 
adverse effect on our business, ˙nancial condition, liquidity, ˙nancial 

results or reputation, refer to section , 
Regulatory environment
 and 
section ˇ, 
Business risks
, respectively. 
General economic conditions 
and˚geopolitical˚events 
Our business and ˙nancial results could be negatively affected by 
adverse economic conditions, including a potential recession. The current 
global economic environment could further exacerbate pre-existing 
risk factors, including those described in this MD& A, in light of slowing 
Canadian economic growth, elevated CPI ination, high interest rates, 
high housing support costs relative to income, and ˙nancial and capital 
market volatility. All of these could negatively affect our business and 
˙nancial results, including by adversely affecting business and customer 
spending and the resulting demand for our products and services, our 
customers™ ˙nancial condition, the availability of our offerings in light of 
supply chain disruptions, and the cost and amount of funding available 
in the ˙nancial markets. 
Furthermore, risk factors including, without limitation, those described in 
this MD&A, could be exacerbated, or become more likely to materialize, 
as a result of geopolitical events, which could have an adverse impact 
on our business or future ˙nancial results and related assumptions, the 
extent of which is dif˙cult to predict . Geopolitical events could adversely 
impact the global economy and cause ˙nancial and capital market 
volatility, broader geopolitical instability and armed conicts, higher 
energy prices, increased inationary pressures limiting consumer and 
business spending and increasing our operating costs, disruptions in 
our supply chain and increased information security threats.

Our regulatory environment inuences our strategies, and adverse 
governmental or regulatory decisions could have negative ˜nancial, 
operational, reputational or competitive consequences for our business 
Although most of our retail services are not price-regulated, government 
agencies and departments such as the CRTC, ISED, Canadian Heritage 
and the Competition Bureau continue to play a signi˙cant role in 
regulatory matters such as establishing and modifying regulations for 
mandatory access to networks, spectrum auctions, the imposition of 
consumer-related codes ofconduct,approval ofacquisitions,broadcast 
and spectrum licensing, foreign ownership requirements, privacy and 
cybersecurity obligations, and control of copyright piracy. As with all 
regulated organizations, strategies are contingent upon regulatory 
decisions. Adverse decisions by governments or regulatory agencies, 
increased regulation or lack of effective anti-piracy remedies could 
have negative ˙nancial, operational, reputational or competitive 
consequences for our business. 
For a discussion of our regulatory environment and the principal risks 
related thereto, refer to section ,

Failure to proactively address our legal and regulatory obligations, and 
our involvement in various claims and legal proceedings, could have an 
adverse effect on our business, ˜nancial performance and reputation 
Changes in laws or regulations, or in how they are interpreted, and 
the adoption of new laws or regulations, as well as pending or future 
litigation, could have an adverse effect on our business, ˙nancial 
performance and reputation. The increase in laws and regulations 
around customer interactions and the technological evolution of 
our business further create an environment of complex compliance 
requirements that must be adequately managed. The failure to monitor 
and comply with legal or regulatory obligations applicable to us could 
expose us to litigation, signi˙cant ˙nes and penalties, and operational 
restrictions, as well as result in reputational harm. Heightened focus 
on consumer protection through provincial legislation and regulatory 
consumer codes, as well as increased legal and regulatory pressure 
in the areas of privacy, accessibility, data governance and other ESG 
topics, require that we build and operationalize enhanced compliance 
frameworks and could further increase the company™s exposure to 
investigations, litigation, sanctions, ˙nes and reputational harm. 
We become involved in various claims and legal proceedings as part of 
our business. For a description of important legal proceedings involving 
us, please see the section entit led

Competitive environment 
Our 
networks 
Our˝products 
and services 
Our˝˙ nancial 
resources 
Competitive activity in our industry is intense and competitive 
dynamics are evolving, contributing to disruptions in each of our 
business segments 
Our market landscape is being reshaped by changing macroeconomic 
and regulatory environments, increasing global and national competition, 
and evolving customer preferences. As our business evolves and 
technological advances drive new services, delivery models and 
strategic partnerships, our competitive landscape continues to intensify 
and expand to include new and emerging competitors, certain of which 
were historically our partners or suppliers, as well as global-scale 
competitors, including, in particular, cloud and OTT service providers, IoT 
hardware and software providers, VoIP providers and other web-based 
players that are penetrating the communications space with signi˙cant 
resources and a large customer base over which to amortize costs. 
Certain of these competitors are changing the competitive landscape by 
establishing a material market presence, which has accelerated in recent 
years. Established competitors further seek to consolidate or expand 
their product offerings through acquisitions in order to increase scale 
and market opportunities in light of these changes in market dynamics. 
In particular, the combination of Rogers Communications˝Inc. (Rogers) 
with Shaw Communications˝Inc. (Shaw)  in April˝˜˚˜˛ created a Canadian 
competitor with larger scale, and the acquisition of Freedom Mobile 
by Vidéotron˝Ltd. (Vidéotron) also increases its scale with a change in 
competitive dynamics in several provinces, which could have adverse 
implications in particular for our Bell CTS segment . Failure to effectively 
respond to such evolving competitive dynamics could adversely affect 
our business and ˙nancial results. 
Technology substitution, IP networks and recent regulatory decisions, 
in particular, continue to facilitate entry in our industry. In addition, 
the effects of government policies that result in the acquisition of 
spectrum at favourable pricing by regional facilities-based wireless 
service providers distort market dynamics. These factors have changed 
industry economics and allowed competitors to launch new products 
and services and gain market share with far less investment in ˙nancial, 
marketing, human, technological and network resources than has 
historically been required. In particular, with regulatory decisions 
mandating wholesale rates for wireline Internet and mobile virtual 
network operator (MVNO) access, competitors can deliver their services 
over our networks, leveraging regulatory obligations applicable to us, 
therefore limiting their need to invest in building their own networks 
and impacting the network-based differentiation of our services. Such 
lower required investment challenges the monetization of our networks 
and our operating model. Moreover, foreign OTT players are currently 
not subject to the same Canadian content investment obligations as 
those imposed on Canadian domestic digital suppliers, which provides 
them with a competitive advantage over us. 
New technologies create a potential for diversifying our product 
and service offerings and create growth opportunities. However, if 
we are unable to develop and deploy new solutions in advance of 
or concurrent ly with our competitors, if the market does not adopt 
these new technologies in pace with our deployment of new solutions, 
or if we fail to adequately assess and manage the risks associated 
with these new solutions, our business and ˙nancial results could be 
adversely affected. 
We expect these trends to continue in the future, and the increased 
competition we face as a result could negatively impact our business 
including, without limitation, in the following ways: 
Ł 
The acceleration of disruptions and disintermediation in each of our 
business segments could adversely affect our business and ˙nancial 
results 
Ł 
Adverse economic conditions, such as economic downturns or
recessions, high interest rates and elevated ination, adverse conditions 
in the ˙nancial markets or a declining level of retail and commercial 
activity, could have a negative impact on the demand for, and prices of, 
our wireline, wireless and media products and services, and improve 
the competitive position of lower-cost providers 
Ł 
Competitors™ aggressive market offers, combined with heightened
customer sensitivity around pricing, could result in pricing pressures, 
lower margins and increased costs of customer acquisition and
retention, and our market share and sales volumes could decrease
if wedo not match competitors™ pricing levels or increase customer 

acquisition and retention spending 
Ł 
Should our value proposition on pricing, network, speed, service
or features not be considered suf˙cient for customers in light of
available alternatives, or should our products and services not be
provided over customers™ preferred delivery channels, this could
lead to increased churn 
Ł 
The shift to online transactions could cause a reduction in in-store
traf˙c, which could adversely impact our ability to leverage our
extensive retail network to increase the number of subscribers and 

sell our products and services 
Ł 
Evolving customer behaviour could result in ongoing customer
suppression of mobile phone data and ofoading onto Wi-Fi networks, 
as well as inuence customer adoption of new services including,
without limitation, G and IoT 
Ł 
The convergence of wireline and wireless services is impacting
product purchase choice by customers and could increase product 

substitution in favour of lower-margin products as well as increase 
churn. These trends are expected to increase with the continued
adoption of G and G+. 
Ł 
Increased embedded SIM (eSIM) adoption makes it easier for customers 
to change service providers and has the potential to upend existing 
distribution models, including negatively impacting roaming revenue 
Ł 
Regulatory decisions regarding wholesale access to our wireless and 
˙bre networks could facilitate entry of new competitors, including OTT 
players, or strengthen the market position of current competitors, or 
encourage existing competitors to expand beyond their traditional
footprint, which may negatively impact our retail subscriber base
in favour of lower-margin wholesale subscribers and thus could
negatively impact our capacity to optimize scale and invest in our

networks 
Ł 
The extent and timely rollout of ˙bre networks and G and G+ mobile 
services may be adversely impacted by government and regulatory 
decisions, constraints on access to and price of network equipment , 

labour shortages and potential operational challenges in delivering

new technology

Cloud-based and OTT-based substitution and the market expansion 
of lower-cost VoIP, collaboration and software-de˙ned networking in 
a wide area network (SD WAN) solutions offered by local and global 

competitors, such as traditional software players, are changing our 
approach to service offerings and pricing and could have an adverse 
effect on our business 
Ł 
Increased insolvency, spending rationalization and consolidation by 

business customers could lead to further disruptions in our Bell CTS 

segment , driven by technology substitution, economic factors and

customers™ operational ef˙ciencies 
Ł 
The pressure from simpler, lower-cost, agile service models is driving 
in-sourcing trends, which could have an adverse impact on our
managed services business 
Ł 
Greater customer adoption of services like G, as well as IoT services 
and applications in the areas of retail (e.g., home automation), business 
(e.g., remote monitoring), transportation (e.g., connected car and asset 
tracking) and urban city optimization (smart cities), combined with the 
increased use of AI, is expected to accelerate competition in these areas 
Ł 
Subscriber and viewer growth is challenged by changing viewer
habits, the expansion and continued market penetration of global
scale low-cost OTT content providers, OT T aggregators and other

alternative service providers, some of which may offer content and 

platforms as loss leaders to support their core business, as well as
account stacking, CRTC arbitration and a fragmentation of audiences 
due to an abundance of choices 
Ł 
Competition, with both global competitors and traditional Canadian 
TV competitors, for programming content could drive signi˙cant
increases in content acquisition and development costs as well as 
reduced access to key content as some competitors withhold content 
to enhance their OT T service offering 
Ł 
The proliferation of content piracy could negatively impact our ability 
to monetize products and services beyond our current expectations, 
while creating bandwidth pressure without corresponding revenue
growth in the context of regulated wholesale high-speed Internet
access rates 
Ł 
Our ability to grow digital and other alternative advertising revenue, 

in the context of a changing and fragmented advertising market , is

being challenged by global-scale players 
Ł 
Traditional radio faces accelerated substitution from new music
players and alternative streaming services such as those offered by 

global audio streaming players and those made available by new

technologies, including smart car services 
Ł 
The launch by Canadian and international competitors of low earth

orbit (LEO) satellites to provide connectivity, primarily in rural areas 

and the North, intensi˙es competition, which could adversely affect 
our network deployment strategy in such areas and negatively
impact demand for our connectivity services. The ability of our
subsidiary Northwestel, operating in Canada™s North, to respond to

thecompetitive threat from these providers is further hampered by 

CRTC retail Internet regulations.

Technology/infrastructure transformation 
Our 
networks
Our customers

Our˝products 
and services 
Our˝˙ nancial 
resources 
 
The evolution and transformation of our networks, systems and 
operations using next-generation technologies, while lowering our 

cost structure, are essential to effective competition and customer 

experience 
Globalization, increased competition and ongoing technological advances 
are driving customer expectations for faster market responses, improved 
customer service, enhanced user experiences and cost-effective 
delivery. Meeting these expectations requires the deployment of new 
service and product technologies along with customer service tools 
that are network-neutral and based on a more collaborative and 
integrated development environment. The availability of improved 
networks and software technologies further provides the foundation 
for better and faster connections, which have in turn led to a signi˙cant 
growth in IoT applications. Change can be dif˙cult and may present 
unforeseen obstacles that might impact successful execution, and this 
transition is made more challenging by the complexity of our multi-
product environment , combined with the complexity of our network 
and IT infrastructure. 
We are pursuing a transformation from a 
telco 
to a techco, which 
entails fundamentally improving the experience and value we deliver 
to customers enabled by modernized infrastructure, simpli˙ed business 
processes, and a right sized cost model. Failure to successfully pursue this 
transformation and accurately assess the potential of new technologies, 
or to invest and evolve in the appropriate direction in an environment 

of changing business models, could limit our ability to deliver value to 

our customers through easy and simple buy and support interactions 
and through enabling them to get what they want much faster through 
any channel, as well as limit our customers™ ability to receive products, 
services and content to any device or location regardless of network 
access type. As a result, this could have an adverse impact on our 
business and ˙nancial results. 
Our network and IT evolution activities seek to use new as well as evolving 
and developing technologies, including network functions virtualization, 
software-de˙ned networks, cloud technologies, 
MEC
, open source 
software, AI and machine learning. They further seek to transform 
our networks and systems through consolidation, virtualization and 
automation to achieve our objectives of becoming more agile in our 
service delivery and operations, as well as providing omni-channel 
capabilities for our customers and driving lower costs. Our evolution 
activities also focus on building next-generation converged wireline 
and wireless networks leveraging smart-core technologies, to enable 
competitive quality and customer experience at a competitive cost 
structure amid rapidly growing capacity requirements. Alignment 
across technology platforms, product and service development and 
operations is increasingly critical to ensure appropriate trade-offs 
and optimization of capital allocation. Failure to adopt best

technology practices in transforming our operations in order to enable 
a truly customer-centric service experience may hinder our ability to 

build customers™ trust in our innovation and technological capabilities 

and our ability to compete on footprint, service experience and cost 
structure. Any one or more of the above could have an adverse impact 
on our business, ˙nancial results and reputation. 
Customer retention and new customer acquisitions may be hindered 
during our transformation activities if such transformation causes poor 
service performance, which in turn may adversely affect our ability to 
achieve operational and ˙nancial objectives. Failure to quickly maximize 
adaptable infrastructures, processes and technologies to ef˙ciently 
respond to evolving customer patterns and behaviours and to leverage IP 
and automation across many facets of our network, product and service 
portfolio could inhibit a fully customer-centric approach. This could 
reduce our ability to provide comprehensive self-serve convenience, 
real-time provisioning, cost savings and exibility in delivery and 
consumption, leading to negative business and ˙nancial outcomes. 
We further seek to expand our network footprint to enhance our value 
proposition and meet customer needs while deploying technologies 
to support growth. However, adverse government, regulatory or 
court decisions may impact the speci˙c nature, magnitude, location 
and timing of investment decisions. In particular, the requirement to 
provide aggregated access to our FT TP 
facilities 
on a wholesale basis, 
lowering of rates by the CRTC of mandated wholesale services over FTTP 
and/or FT TN, the imposition of unfavourable terms or the adoption of 
unfavourable rates in arbitration processes associated with the facilities-
based MVNO access service the CRTC has implemented, the potential 
for additional mandated access to our networks, or the imposition of 
broader wholesale obligations on wireless networks would undermine 
the incentives for facilities-based digital infrastructure providers to invest 
in next-generation wireline and wireless networks. Failure to continue 
investment in next-generation capabilities in a disciplined, timely and 
strategic manner could limit our ability to compete effectively and to 
achieve desired business and ˙nancial results. 
Other examples of risks that could affect the achievement of our desired 
technology/infrastructure transformation include the following: 
Ł 
The current global economic environment as well as geopolitical events 
may bring about further incremental costs, delays or unavailability
of equipment, materials and resources, which may impact our ability 
to continue building next-generation converged networks and drive 

other transformation initiatives 
Ł 
Challenges in hiring, retaining, insourcing, and developing technical 
and skilled resources could adversely impact transformation activities. 
Potential deterioration in employee morale and de-prioritization of
transformation initiatives due to staff reductions, cost reductions
or reorganizations could adversely affect our transformation and
˙nancial results. 
Ł 
Suboptimal capital deployment in network build, infrastructure and
process upgrades, and customer service improvements, could hinder 
our ability to compete effectively 
Ł 
Execution risk and lower or slower than expected savings achieved 
through targeted savings initiatives (e.g., vendor management ,
real estate optimization) could impact our ability to invest in the
transformation 
Ł 
We, and other telecommunications carriers upon which we rely to

provide services, must be able to purchase high-quality, reputable
network equipment and services from third-party suppliers on a
timely basis and at a reasonable cost 
Ł 
Network construction and deployment on municipal or private property 
requires the issuance of municipal or property owner consents,
respectively, for the installation of network equipment , which could

increase the cost of, and cause delays in, ˙bre and wireless rollouts 
Ł 
The successful deployment of G mobile services could be impacted 
by various factors affecting coverage and costs 
Ł 
Higher demand for faster Internet speed and capacity, coupled with 

governmental policies and initiatives, creates tensions around FTTP

deployment in terms of geographic preference and pace of rollout 
Ł 
The increasing dependence on applications for content delivery, sales, 
customer engagement and service experience drives the need for

new and scarce capabilities (sourced internally or externally), that

may not be available, as well as the need for associated operating

processes integrated into ongoing operations 
Ł 
New products, services or applications could reduce demand for our 
existing, more pro˙table service offerings or cause prices for those 
services to decline, and could result in a shorter life cycle for existing 
or developing technologies, which could increase depreciation and

amortization expense 
Ł 
The decommissioning of legacy equipment could be challenged by

customer requirements to continue using older technologies as well 

as inherent risks involved with transitioning to new systems 
Ł 
As content providers™ business models change, content consumption 
habits evolve and viewing options increase, our ability to aggregate 
and distribute relevant content and our ability to develop alternative 
delivery vehicles to compete in new markets and increase customer 
engagement and revenue streams may be hindered by the signi˙cant 
software development and network investment required 
Ł 
Successfully managing the development and deployment of relevant 
product solutions on a timely basis to match the speed of adoption of 
IoT in the areasof retail,businessand governmentcould be challenging 
Ł 
Customers continue to expect improvements in customer service, new 
functions and features, and reductions in the price charged to provide 
those services. Our ability to provide such improvements increasingly 
relies upon using a number of rapidly evolving technologies, including AI, 
machine learning and ﬁbig dataﬂ. However, the use of such technologies 
is being increasingly scrutinized by legislators and regulators. If we 
cannot build market-leading competencies in the use of these emerging 
technologies in a way that respects societal values, we may not be
able to continue to meet changing customer expectations and to
continue to grow our business.

revenues, increasing by ˚.ˇ% year 
over 
year, mainly from higher 
wireless and Internet revenues combined with the contribution from 
various acquisitions made during the year. This was moderated by 
continued erosion in legacy voice, data and satellite TV revenues, as 
well as lower media advertising revenues, primarily driven by ongoing 
unfavourable economic conditions. 
In ˜˚˜˛, net earnings decreased by ˜˚.%, compared to ˜˚˜˜, due to 
higher other expense mainly due to losses on our equity investments 
in associates and joint ventures which included a loss on BCE™s share 
of an obligation to repurchase at fair value the minority interest in one 
of BCE™s joint ventures, higher interest expense, higher depreciation 
and amortization and higher severance, acquisition and other costs, 
part ly offset by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower impairment of assets. 
BCE™s adjusted EBITDA grew by ˜.ˆ% in ˜˚˜˛, compared to last year, driven 
by growth from our Bell CTS segment , part ly offset by a decline in our 
Bell Media segment. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA 
reected higher operating revenues, partly offset by increased operating 
expenses, primarily attributable to greater cost of revenue, associated 
with the revenue growth, moderated by various cost reduction initiatives 
and operating ef˙ciencies. This drove a corresponding adjusted EBITDA 
margin of ˜.˜% in ˜˚˜˛, which remained unchanged from last year. 
In ˜˚˜˛, BCE™s cash ows from operating activities decreased by 
$ˆˇ˝million, compared to ˜˚˜˜, mainly due to lower cash from working 
capital, in part from timing of supplier payments, and higher interest 
paid, partly offset by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower contributions 
to post-employment bene˙t plans. 
Free cash ow increased by $˝ million in ˜˚˜˛, compared to ˜˚˜˜, 
mainly due to lower capital expenditures, part ly offset by lower cash 
ows from operating activities, excluding cash from acquisition and 
other costs paid.

 at the beginning of this MD& A. 
Competitive landscape 
Wireless products and services 
The Canadian wireless industry has experienced strong subscriber 
growth in recent years, supported by immigration and population 
growth, a continued increase in the rate of penetration in line with the 
trend toward multiple devices, and the ongoing adoption of mobile 
devices and services. With penetration rates in other developed nations 
well above ˆ˚˚% (United States, Europe and Asia), the Canadian mobile 
phone penetration rate is expected to continue to increase, above and 
beyond the approximate rate of ˇˆ% for ˜˚˜˛. 
In ˜˚˜˛, the Canadian wireless industry continued to experience 
heightened levels of competition nationally,particularly within the anker 
brand environment . This competitive intensity has led to continued 
declines in chargeable data usage and rising levels of data allocation 
in monthly plans, including unlimited data plans, in addition to other 
ongoing factors, such as the popularity of data sharing plans and an 
evolving shift in the customer mix toward non-traditional mobile devices 
and tools such as video chats. The roll-out of G network infrastructure 
continued in ˜˚˜˛, with G coverage by the national carriers reaching 
approximately % of the Canadian population at the end of ˜˚˜˛, 
compared to approximately ˚% at the end of ˜˚˜˜. F
standing focus on network excellence is reected in the recognition 
we received from independent third-party sources in ˜˚˜˛, including 
being recognized as Canada™s fastest and best G network by GWS 
for the third consecutive year in its˝˜˚˜˛ nationwide assessment of 
G˝networks. New this year, GWS™s testing included˝˛˚˚˝MHz network 
wireless spectrum and determined Bell™s network (G+) performance 
to be the fastest and best in the country. 
The Canadian wireless industry remains highly competitive and capital-
intensive among facilities-based providers, as carriers continue to 
expand and enhance their broadband wireless networks, including 
the ongoing build-out of G, as well as making signi˙cant investments 
in spectrum. 
Competitors for wireless products and services 
Ł 
Facilities-based national wireless service providers Rogers, the Telus 
Corporation group of companies (Telus) and Québecor˝Inc. (Québecor) 
Ł 
Regional facilities-based wireless service providers Saskatchewan
Telecommunications Holding Corporation, which provides service in 
Saskatchewan; Bragg Communications˝Inc. (Eastlink), which provides 
service in the three Maritime provinces 
Wireline products and services 
The cable market changed in˝˜˚˜˛ as Rogers completed its acquisition of 
 
Shaw, creating a Canadian competitor with larger scale. An estimated 
 
.˝million Internet subscribers received their service over the networks 
 
of the three largest cable companies at the end of ˜˚˜˛, relatively 
 
unchanged from ˜˚˜˜. Meanwhile, an estimated .˝million Internet 
subscribers received their service over the networks of incumbent 
local exchange carriers (ILECs) like Bell at the end of ˜˚˜˛, compared to 
approximately .˜˝million at the end of ˜˚˜˜. Bell continues to make gains 
in market share as a result of the ongoing expansion of our FTTP direct 
˙bre network and increased customer penetration of bundled service 
offerings. Our ongoing focus on FT TP and its superior characteristics 
as compared to cable, such as higher and symmetrical download and 
upload speeds, has allowed us to connect more than ˝million homes 
and˝businesses in Ontario, Québec, the Atlantic provinces and Manitoba 
to our pure ˙bre technology. Notably, Bell pure ˙bre Internet was 
awarded fastest in Canada in Ookla™s Qˆ-Q˜˝and Q˛-Q˝˜˚˜˛˝Speedtest 
Awards reports, with the reports also ranking Bell pure ˙bre Wi-Fi as 
fastest in the country Œ both for the second time in a row. In addition, Bell 
was named the Best Major & All Around ISP in PCMag™s Best ISPs˝˜˚˜˛ 
Canada report. Bell recognitions also include BrandSpark™s Most Trusted 
ISP˝˜˚˜˛ and ˜˚˜. 
While Canadians still watch conventional TV, digital streaming platforms 
are playing an increasingly important role in the broadcasting industry 
and in the distribution of content . Popular online video services are 
providing Canadians with more choice about where, when and how to 
access video content . In ˜˚˜˛, ILECs offering IPTV service expanded their 
subscriber base by an estimated % to reach ˛.˝million customers, or 
a ˛% market share, up compared to approximately ˛% at the end of 
˜˚˜˜, through wider network coverage, enhanced differentiated services 
and bundled offerings, and marketing and promotions focused on IPTV. 
Canada™s three largest cable companies had an estimated .˝million TV 
subscribers, or a ˚% market share at the end of ˜˚˜˛, up compared 
to % at the end of ˜˚˜˜. The balance of industry subscribers were 
served by satellite TV and regional providers. 
In recent years, two of the largest Canadian cable companies have 
launched new TV services based on the Comcast Xˆ˝video platform 
 
Œ Rogers (and previously Shaw prior to its acquisition by Rogers) and
 
Québecor™s Vidéotron brand. Our IPTV platform (Fibe TV, Fibe TV ap
p
 
and Virgin Plus TV) continues to offer numerous service advantages
 
compared to this cable platform, including: exible pricing plans and
 
packages available to all customers; picture clarity and quality; content 
 
depth and breadth; the number of ways customers can access content, 
 
including wireless set-top boxes, Restart TV, higher-capacity PVR˝and the 
 
Fibe TV app. We continue to offer more on-demand content and˝more 
 
OTT
 content with Crave, Netix, Prime Video˝and YouTube all in one place.

The financial performance of the overall Canadian wireline 
telecommunications market continues to be impacted by the ongoing 
declines in legacy voice service revenues resulting from technological 
substitution to wireless and OT T services, as well as by the ongoing 
conversion to IP-based data services and networks by large business 
customers. Canada™s three largest cable companies had an estimated 
combined base of approximately ˜.˝million telephony subscribers at 
the end of ˜˚˜˛, representing a national residential market share of 
approximately ˆ%, relatively at compared to ˜˚˜˜. Telecommunications 
companies had an estimated combined total of ˛.˛˝million telephony 
subscribers at the end of ˜˚˜˛, representing a market share of 
approximately ˚%, up compared to approximately ˇ% at the end 
of ˜˚˜˜. Other non-facilities-based competitors also offer local and 
long distance VoIP services and resell high-speed Internet services.

such as Telus, Rogers, Chubb Fire & Security and Stanley Security.

Competitors also include do-it-yourself security providers such as
Lorex and home automation service providers such as Ring, Nest
and Wyze. 
Industry trends 
Wireless products and services 
Wireless growth continues to be driven by the ongoing increase in data 
usage and adoption, including: higher- value smartphones, unlimited 
data offerings, shared family data plans, and IoT devices. In addition, 

consumers continue to replace wireline access services with wireless 
access and related data services. These trends are expected to drive 
the growing demand for wireless data services for the foreseeable 

future, particularly as the industry continues to shift to G. Industry 
ARPU is expected to continue moderating, compared to periods prior 
to the˝COVID-ˆˇ˝pandemic, particularly now that the industry has 
lapped the meaningful recovery in roaming revenues, which had fallen 
during the peak of the COVID-ˆˇ˝pandemic. Furthermore, as a result of 
increased competitive intensity, the industry continues to see greater 
adoption of bring-your-own-device (BYOD) additions, resulting in 
increased switching activity. 
While LTE and LTE-A technologies increase download speeds, encourage 
data usage and enhance the customer experience, growth in data 
traf˙c poses challenges to mobile access technology. To better manage 
this data traf˙c, Canadian providers continue to evolve their networks 
and deploy spectrum to support the shift to G. ISED held its auction 
of spectrum in the˝˛˚˚ MHz band in the fourth quarter of˝˜˚˜˛ and 
announced an auction for millimetre wave (mmWave) spectrum; these 
bands are important for the expansion of G networks. 
IoT technologies connect communications-enabled devices via wireless 
technologies, allowing them to exchange key information and share 
processes. Advanced platforms and networks are already in place 
in industries such as transportation and logistics, utilities and eet 
management, with deployment ongoing in other sectors, including 
smart cities, manufacturing, retail, food services, consumer utilities, and 
connected cars. These industries are adopting IoT solutions, combined 
with other applications, to digitally transform their operations and 
generate value from their connections. IoT presents a meaningful 
opportunity for growth in wireless connectivity, which can deliver 
services to customers more ef˙cient ly. IoT connectivity generally 
has a lower ARPU when sold as a stand-alone service, but supports 
both revenue and margin growth, since it often leads to the sale of 
IoT applications or our other service offerings, enhancing customer 
penetration. In ˜˚˜˛, we added ˜ˇ˛,˛˚˝mobile connected devices, 
bringing our mobile connected device subscriber base to more than 
˜.˝million, up ˆˆ% from ˜˚˜˜. 
Wireline products and services 
The wireline telecommunications market is expected to remain very 
competitive in ˜˚˜. Although the residential high-speed internet market 
is maturing, with a penetration rate of approximately ˇ˜% across Canada 
at the end of ˜˚˜˛, subscriber growth is expected to continue over the 
coming years. Technology substitution, including the growth of wireless 
and VoIP services, is expected to continue to replace higher-margin 
legacy voice revenues, while digital streaming services and other online 
content providers are expected to impact current linear TV services. Bell 
is an important provider of these substitution services and the decline 
in this legacy business is continuing as expected.

The popularity of viewing TV and on-demand content anywhere, 
particularly on handheld devices, is expected to continue to grow as 
customers adopt services that enable them to view content on multiple 
screens. Streaming media providers continue to enhance OTT and DTC 
streaming services in order to compete for a share of viewership in 
response to evolving viewing habits and consumer demand. TV providers 
are monitoring OT T developments and seeking to adapt their content 
and market strategies to compete with these non-traditional offerings. 
We view OTT as an opportunity to add further capabilities to our linear 
and on-demand assets, providing customers with exible options to 
choose the content they want and encouraging greater customer usage 
of Bell™s high-speed Internet and wireless networks. In ˜˚˜˛, our Crave 
streaming service expanded its DTC subscription offering with the 
launch of ad-supported plans, giving customers a range of options to 
access Crave™s lineup of premium content . And we are expanding the 

reach of Crave in˝˜˚˜ through our agreement with Amazon to make 
Crave available on Prime Video Channels in Canada. 
The Canadian ILECs continue to make signi˙cant capital investments in 
broadband networks, with a focus on FTTP to maintain and enhance their 
ability to support advanced IP-based services and higher broadband 
speeds. Cable companies continue to evolve their cable networks with 
DOCSIS-related bandwidth enhancements and node splitting. Although 
Business out look and assumptions 
the platform increases speed in the near term and is cost-ef˙cient , it 
does not offer the advanced capabilities of FTTP over the longer term, 
such as fast symmetrical upload and download speeds. At the end of 
˜˚˜˛, approximately .˝million locations in Bell™s footprint had access 
to multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds of ˛˝Gbps. 
In the business market, the convergence of IT and telecommunications, 
facilitated by the ubiquity of IP, continues to shape the competitive 
environment , with non-traditional providers increasingly blurring the 
lines of competition and business models. Cable companies continue 
to make investments to better compete in the highly contested small 
and medium-sized business space. Telecommunications companies 
like Bell are providing network-centric managed applications that 
leverage their signi˙cant FT TP investments, while IT service providers 
are bundling network connectivity with their proprietary 
as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. The development of IP-based platforms, 
which provide combined IP voice, data and video solutions, creates 
potential cost ef˙ciencies that compensate, in part , for reduced margins 
resulting from the continuing shift from legacy to IP-based services. The 
evolution of IT has created signi˙cant opportunities for our business 
markets services, such as cloud, security and workow automation 
solutions
, that can have a greater business impact than traditional 
telecommunications services. 
This section contains forward-looking statements, including relating to our projected ˙nancial performance for˝˜˚˜ and our business out look, 
objectives, plans and strategic priorities. Refer to the section 
Caution regarding forward-looking statements
 at the beginning of this MD&A. 
˛˝˛˘˚outlook 
Our outlook for ˜˚˜ takes into consideration the ˙nancial impact of our 
strategic distribution partnership with Best Buy Canada that will result 
in a decrease in largely consumer electronics related revenue from 
Bell CTS results. The impact of this partnership on adjusted EBITDA will 
not be material given relatively low margins for consumer electronics. 
We 
are targeting revenue growth driven by continued subscriber 
base expansion. 
Wireless subscriber growth is expected to be supported by an ongoing 
G upgrade cycle, strong immigration levels and our continued focus 
on multi-product cross sales. We are focused on increasing our market 
share of national operators™ postpaid mobile phone net additions in a 
disciplined and cost-conscious manner. We expect higher, but more 
moderate, growth in ARPU driven by increased G subscriptions and 
higher roaming revenue, partly offset by reduced data overage revenue 
resulting from the continued adoption of unlimited plans. We will also 
seek to achieve higher revenues from the ow-through of pricing 
changes, as well as IoT services and applications. 
Continued expansion of our retail Internet and IPTV subscriber bases is 
expected to be supported by a broader FT TP service footprint together 
with higher household penetration, further penetration of WHI access 
technology in rural communities, further scaling of Bell™s app-based 
live TV streaming services and the introduction of new products and 
features. We will continue to focus on winning the home by leveraging 
our symmetrical Internet speed advantage over cable, delivering the 
best customer experience with our products, and driving greater 
cross-sell penetration of higher value mobility and Internet households. 
In our business markets, we expect an improving ˙nancial performance 
trajectory predicated on higher product sales and project spending 
by large enterprise customers combined with wireless subscriber 
growth. However, as large enterprise customers continue to look for 
opportunities to leverage low-cost technologies to grow and transform 
the workforce of the future and face increased uncertainty about future 
economic conditions, spending on telecommunications services and 
products is expected to be variable. In addition, ongoing customer 
migrations from traditional technologies to IP-based systems and 
demand for cheaper bandwidth alternatives will continue to impact 
business markets™ results in ˜˚˜. We intend to seek to offset the 
revenue decline from traditional legacy telecommunications services 

by continuing to develop unique services and value enhancements to 
improve the client experience through services such as cloud, security 
and workforce automation solutions. Further, we intend to use marketing 
initiatives and other customer-speci˙c strategies with the objective 
ofslowing 
the pace of NAS erosion, while also investing in direct ˙bre 
expansion, G and new solutions in key portfolios such as Internet, 
private networks, voice and uni˙ed communications, cloud solutions, 
security solutions, cloud-based contact centre, IoT and MEC. We will 
also continue to focus on delivering network-centric managed and 
professional services solutions to large and medium-sized businesses 
that increase the value of connectivity services.

We expect the overall level of competitive intensity in our small and 
medium-sized business markets to remain high, as cable operators and 
other telecom competitors look to these customer segments as potential 
growth opportunities. We also intend to expand key sales channels and 
introduce service offerings that help drive innovative solutions and 
value for our small and medium-sized customers by leveraging Bell™s 
network assets, broadband ˙bre footprint and service capabilities to 
expand our relationships with them. 
We are maintaining a sharp focus on our operating cost structure to 
help offset pressures related to customer growth and retention, the 
ongoing erosion of high-margin wireline voice and other legacy revenues, 
and competitive repricing pressures in our residential, business and 
wholesale markets. This, combined with further operating ef˙ciencies 
enabled by our direct ˙bre footprint, changes in consumer behaviour and 
product innovation, digital adoption, product and service enhancements, 
expanding self-serve capabilities, new call centre and digital investments, 
other improvements to the customer service experience, management 
workforce reductions including attrition and retirements, and lower 
contracted rates from our suppliers, is expected to deliver meaningful 
cost savings and productivity gains across the organization.

Principal business risks 
This section discusses certain principal business risks speci˙cally related to the Bell CTS segment. For a detailed description of the other principal 
risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, refer to section ˇ, 
Business risks
. 
Regulatory environment 
Risk 
Ł 
Increased regulation of wireless services, pricing and infrastructure, 
such as additional mandated access to wireless networks, establishing 
rates for mandated wireless services that are materially different from 
the rates we propose, and limitations placed on future spectrum bidding 
Ł 
The CRTC has mandated the establishment of an aggregated wholesale 
high-speed access service available on FT TP facilities in Ontario and 
Québec 
on an interim basis, and at rates that are materially lower
from the rates we proposed, and which do not suf˙ciently account
for the investment required in these facilities. The CRTC may maintain, 
reverse or otherwise modify this new obligation when it concludes

its ongoing wholesale high-speed access review. This new service
materially improves the business position of our competitors. On
February˝ˇ, ˜˚˜, the Federal Court of Appeal granted Bell Canada
leave to appeal the 
CRTC 
decision but declined to grant the requested 
stay of the decision pending resolution of its appeal. Bell Canada has 
also ˙led an appeal to the Governor-in-Council. 
Ł 
The courts could overturn the new wholesale rates the CRTC set for 
aggregated high-speed access service in ˜˚˜ˆ, which were much
higher than the rates it had proposed in ˜˚ˆˇ 
Potential impact
Ł 
Increased regulation could inuence network investment and the
market structure, limit our exibility, improve the business position of 
our competitors, limit network-based differentiation of our services, and 
negatively impact the ˙nancial performance of our Bell CTS segment 
Ł 
In respect of the potential for new aggregated wholesale high-speed 
access service available on FT TP facilities
:
 (i) the mandating of ˙nal
rates that are materially different from the rates we proposed
;
 (ii)
the risk that the wholesale FTTP obligation will only be imposed on

Bell Canada and not other providers or only in Ontario and 
Québec
while 
not available to Bell Canada in Western Canada
,
 putting Bell
Canada at a competitive disadvantage where it could not access
wholesale FTTP out of its traditional territory, but its major competitors 
could access Bell Canada™s FT TP facilities
;
 and (iii) in the case of our
existing wholesale high-speed access service, the implementation
of the rates for aggregated or disaggregated wholesale high-speed 
access services, could change our investment strategy, especially in 
relation to investment in next-generation wireline networks in smaller 
communities and rural areas, improve the business position of our
competitors, further accelerate penetration and disintermediation
by OT T players, and negatively impact the ˙nancial performance of 

our business. 
Aggressive competition 
Risk 
Ł 
The intensity of competitive activity from national wireless operators, 
smaller or regional facilities-based wireless service providers,
non-traditional players and resellers 
Ł 
The intensity of competitive activity coupled with the proliferation of 
installment and/or buy and pay later plans, and new wireline product 
launches for residential customers (e.g., IoT, smart home systems
and devices, innovative TV platforms, etc.) and business customers
(e.g., OTT VoIP, collaboration and SD WAN solutions) from national
operators, non-traditional players and wholesalers, including the
expanded offering of retail services based on wholesale access by

large facilities-based competitors 
Potential impact
Ł 
Pressure on our revenue, adjusted EBITDA, ARPU, cash ows and churn 
would likely result if wireless competitors continue to aggressively
pursue new types of price plans, increase discounts, offer shared plans 
based on sophisticated pricing requirements (e.g., installments) or offer 
other incentives, such as cash-back for upgrade with old smartphone 
and multi-product bundles, in order to attract new customers 
Ł 
An increase in the intensity level of competitive activity for wireline
services could result in lost revenue, higher churn and increased
acquisition and retention expenses, all of which would put pressure 

on Bell CTS™s adjusted EBITDA 
Market environment, technological advancement
andˆchanging customer behaviour
Risk
Ł 
Slower subscriber growth due to high Canadian Internet and
smartphone penetration, combined with potential pressures from
the economic environment and reduced discretionary spending, and 
potential varying levels of immigration 
Ł 
With technological advancement, the traditional TV viewing model (i.e., 
a subscription for bundled channels) is challenged by an increasing 
number of legal and illegal viewing options available in the market

offered by traditional, non-traditional and global players, as well as 

increasing cord-cutting and cord-shaving trends 
Ł 
The proliferation of network technologies impacts business customers™ 
decision to migrate to OTT, VoIP and/or leverage SD WAN architecture 
Ł 
Changing customer habits further contribute to the erosion of NAS lines 
Potential impact 
Ł 
A maturing wireline and wireless market could challenge subscriber 

growth and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, putting 

pressure on the ˙nancial performance of our business 
Ł 
Our market penetration and number of TV subscribers could decline 
as a result of innovative offerings by BDUs and an increasing number 
of domestic and non-domestic unregulated OTT providers, as well as 
a signi˙cant volume of content piracy 
Ł 
The proliferation of IP-based products, including OTT content and
OT T software offerings direct ly to consumers, may accelerate the

disconnection of TV services or the reduction of TV spending, as well 

as the reduction in business IT investments by customers 
Ł 
The ongoing loss of NAS lines challenges our traditional voice revenues 
and compels us to develop other service offerings

of ˆˇ% in ˜˚˜˛, which moderated the overall 
year-over-year pressure in operating revenues. 
Ł 
Advertising revenues
 declined by .% in ˜˚˜˛, compared to last
year, due to lower demand from advertisers as a result of 
the
ongoing unfavourable economic conditions, which negatively impacted 
revenues across our TV and radio platforms. TV advertising revenues, in 
particular 
c
onventional TV revenues, were also unfavourably impacted 
by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild
and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) 
strikes, along with the unfavourable year-over-year impact on 
s
pecialty 
TV due to the bene˙t last year from the˝broadcast of the FIFA World

Competitive landscape and industr y trends 
This section contains forward-looking statements, including related to our business out look. Refer to the section 
Caution regarding forward-
looking statements
 at the beginning of this MD& A. 
Competitive landscape 
Competition for content in the Canadian media industry continues to 
be increasingly controlled by a small number of global competitors 
with signi˙cant scale and ˙nancial resources. Technology has allowed 
new entrants to become media players in their own right. Some players 
have become more vertically integrated across both traditional and 
emerging platforms to better enable the acquisition and monetization 
of premium content . Global aggregators have also emerged and are 

competing for both content and viewers. 
Bell Media competes in the TV, radio, OOH advertising and digital media 
markets: 
Ł 
TV:
 The TV market has become increasingly fragmented and this trend 
is expected to continue as new services and technologies increase

the diversity of information and entertainment outlets available to

consumers 
Ł 
Radio: 
Competition within the radio broadcasting industry occurs
primarily in discrete local market areas among individual stations 
Ł 
OOH: 
TheCanadianOOHadvertising industry isfragmented, consisting 
of a few large companies as well as numerous smaller and local
companies operating in a few local markets 
Ł 
Digital media:
 Consumer demand for digital media, content on mobile 
devices, and on-demand content is increasing and media products
have experienced signi˙cant digital uptake, requiring industry players 
to increase their efforts in digital content and capabilities in order

tocompete. In response to this trend, advertisers are shifting their
spending to premium video and audio products on global digital
platforms and social media that enable marketers to narrowly target 
speci˙c audiences instead of the previous mass marketing approach. 
Thisresultsin loweruse oftraditionaladvertising methods and requires 
a shift in focus. Bell Media and other media companies have initiated 
programs to sell their advertising inventory on a more targeted basis 
through updated buying platforms with enhanced access to data and 
are now selling their inventory on programmatic buying platforms. 
In ˜˚˜˛, the Canadian advertising market continued to experience
a slowdown consistent with trends in the global advertising market .
Improvementis 
expected in the medium term, although visibility as to 
the speci˙c timing and pace of recovery remains limited.

Industry trends 
Consumers continue to have access to an array of online entertainment 
and information alternatives, with new options being added yearly. The 
increase in alternative entertainment options has led to a fragmentation 
in consumption habits. Traditional linear TV still delivers higher viewership 
compared to other forms of video consumption, although the gap is 
closing with more people consuming content from an assortment of 
services and in a variety of formats. In particular, today™s viewers are 
consuming more content online, watching less scheduled programming 
live, time-shifting original broadcasts through PVRs, viewing more video 
on mobile devices, and catching up on an expanded library of past 
programming on-demand. While households use pure OTT services, such 
as Crave, Netix, Prime Video, Disney+ and Apple TV+, to complement 
linear TV consumption, an increasing number are using these services as 
alternatives to a traditional linear package. With the increase of options 
in the alternative market, content is more widespread than ever before 
across providers, resulting in a more competitive landscape. This has 
resulted in price increases and consumers™ need to subscribe to more 
than one service. The industry has responded with bundling options, 
lower price ad tiers, and an increase in free, ad-supported streaming 
television (FAST) channels, such as The Roku Channel, Tubi and Pluto TV. 
Premium video content remains vitally important to media companies in 
attracting and retaining viewers and advertisers. This content, including 
live sports and special events, should continue to draw audiences and 
advertisers moving forward. Heightened competition for these rights 
from global competitors, including Netix, Prime Video, Disney+, DAZN 
and Apple TV+, has already resulted in higher program rights costs and 
may also make it more dif˙cult to secure content . 
Consumer behaviour is continually changing and media companies 
are adjusting by evolving and personalizing their content and product 
offerings. Media companies have launched their own solutions with the 
objective of better competing with non-traditional offerings through 
DTC products such as Bell Media™s bilingual Crave service, TSN and 

RDS, all of which offer streaming on a variety of platforms. While the 
SVOD model continues to dominate the streaming landscape, AVOD 
and FAST services are seeing tremendous growth due to the appeal 
to price-conscious consumers. 
In addition, there has been a shift in how advertisers want to buy 
advertising across all media platforms. The growth of digital consumption 
has also given advertisers the opportunity to buy more targeted 
inventory and to buy inventory via self-serve and programmatically. As 
a result, Bell Media and other media companies have initiated programs 
to sell their advertising inventory on a more targeted basis through 
updated buying platforms with enhanced access to data and are now 
selling their inventory on programmatic buying platforms. 
Business out look and assumptions 
This section contains forward-looking statements, including relating to our projected ˙nancial performance for˝˜˚˜ and our business out look, 
objectives, plans and strategic priorities. Refer to the section 
Caution regarding forward-looking statements
 at the beginning of this MD& A. 
˛˝˛˘˚outlook 
We 
are targeting positive media revenue growth in ˜˚˜. While the 
advertising market continues to be adversely affected by economic 
uncertainty, we expect a recovery in ˜˚˜, although visibility as to the 
speci˙c timing and pace of recovery remains limited. Subscriber revenue 
is expected to reect the non-recurrence of revenue adjustments in 
˜˚˜˛, but moderated by BDU rate increases and continued scaling 
of DTC products, such as Crave, including expanded distribution and 
price increases. The effects of shifting media consumption towards 
competing OT T and digital platforms, as well as further TV cord-shaving 
and cord-cutting, are also expected to continue to negatively impact 
subscriber volumes. 
We remain focused on advancing our digital-˙rst media strategy, 
including growing digital revenues and DTC subscribers, and increasing 
usage of our ad buying optimization platforms. We also intend to 
continue controlling costs by achieving productivity gains and pursuing 
operational ef˙ciencies across all of our media properties, while 
continuing to invest in premium content across all screens and platforms.

Across our media properties, particularly in TV, we intend to leverage 
our market position combined with enhanced audience targeting to 
offer advertisers, both nationally and locally, premium opportunities 
to reach their target audiences. Success in this area requires that 
we focus on successfully acquiring highly rated programming and 
differentiated content; building and maintaining strategic supply 
arrangements for content across all screens and platforms; and 
producing and commissioning high-quality Canadian content, including 
market-leading news. We will also continue scaling our SAM TV and 
Bell DSP ad buying optimization platforms, which give customers the 
ability to plan, activate and measure marketing campaigns using Bell™s 
premium ˙rst-party data and expanding personalization of ad content 
to TV and digital radio. 
Our sports offerings are expected to continue to deliver popular content 
and viewing experiences to our TV and DTC audiences. These offerings, 
combined with the integration of our digital platforms, are integral parts 
of our strategy to enhance viewership and engagement . We will also 

continue to focus on creating innovative high-quality productions in 
the areas of sports news and editorial coverage. 
In non-sports specialty TV, audiences and advertising revenues are 
expected to be driven by investment in quality programming and 
production. 
Through Crave, our bilingual premium video streaming service, we will 
continue to leverage our investments in premium content (including 
HBO, Max, STARZ and original French-language programming) in order 
to attract pay TV and DTC subscribers. We intend to continue expanding 
platform distribution and delivering user experience improvements. 
We will continue to support original French programming with a focus 
on digital platforms such as Crave, 
Noovo.ca 
and iHeartRadio, to better 
 
serve our French-language customers through a personalized digital 
 
experience. 
In radio, we intend to offer advertisers, both nationally and locally, 
attractive opportunities to reach their target audiences. Additionally, 
in conjunction with our TV properties, we will continue to pursue 
opportunities that leverage our promotional capabilities, provide an 
expanded platform for content sharing, and offer other synergistic 
ef˙ciencies. 
In our OOH operations, we plan to provide advertisers with attractive 
opportunities in key Canadian markets. We will also continue to seek 
new opp
ortunities to support the growing demand in digital, including 
converting certain outdoor structures to digital and adding new boards. 
Our proposed acquisition of the Canadian out-of-home media business 
of OUTFRONT Media˝Inc., which is expected to close in the ˙rst half of 
˜˚˜, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions, is 
expected to support our digital media strategy and to deliver impactful, 
multi-channel marketing solutions coast-to-coast .

Principal business risks 
This section discusses certain principal business risks speci˙cally related to the Bell Media segment. For a detailed description of the other 
principal risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, refer to section ˇ, 
Business risks
. 
Advertising and subscription revenue uncertainty 
Risk 
Ł 
Advertising is heavily dependent on economic conditions and
viewership, and traditional media is under increasing pressure for
advertising spend against dominant non-traditional/global digital
services 
Ł 
The advertising market could be further impacted by cancelled
or delayed advertising campaigns from many sectors due to the
economic environment 
Ł 
Bell Media has contracts with a variety of BDUs, under which monthly 
subscription fees for specialty and pay TV services are earned, that 

expire on a speci˙c date 
Potential impact
Ł 
Economic uncertainty could continue to impact advertisers™ spending. 
Our failure to increase or maintain viewership or capture our share 
of the changing and fragmented advertising market, including digital 
revenues, could result in the loss of advertising revenue. 
Ł 
If we are not successful in obtaining favourable agreements with
BDUs, it could result in the loss of subscription revenue 
Aggressive competition 
Risk 
Ł 
The intensity of competitive activity from new technologies and
alternative distribution platforms such as unregulated OT T content
offerings, VOD, personal video platforms, DTC distribution and pirated 
content, in addition to traditional TV services, in combination with the 
development of more aggressive product and sales strategies by
non-traditional global players with a much larger scale 
Potential impact
Ł 
Increased competitive activity in combination with the development of 
more aggressive product and sales strategies could have an adverse 
impact on the level of subscriptions and/or viewership for Bell Media™s 
TV services and on Bell Media™s revenue streams 
Rising content costs and ability to secure key content
Risk
Ł 
Rising content costs, as an increasing number of domestic and global 
competitors seek to acquire the same content or to restrict content 

within their own ecosystems, and the ability to acquire or develop

key differentiated content to drive revenues and subscriber growth 
Potential impact
Ł 
Rising programming costs could require us to incur unplanned
expenses, which could result in negative pressure on adjusted EBITDA 
Ł 
Our inability to acquire or develop popular programming content could 
adversely affect Bell Media™s viewership and subscription levels and, 
consequent ly, advertising and subscription revenues

BCE capital expenditures

$˜˝million, compared to ˜˚˜˜, with a corresponding capital intensity 
ratio of ˆ.%, down ˜.˝pts over last year. The decline was driven by 
lower capital expenditures in our Bell CTS segment of $˚˝million 
as a result of lower planned capital spending in˝ ˜˚˜˛ subsequent to 
accelerated network investments in ˜˚˜˜, as well as an unplanned 
additional $ˆ˚˝million decrease in Q ˜˚˜˛ as a result of the CRTC™s 
decision in November˝˜˚˜˛ to mandate wholesale access to Bell™s FTTP

Business acquisitions 
On June˝ˆ, ˜˚˜˛, Bell acquired FX Innovation, a Montréal-based provider 
of cloud-focused managed and professional services and workow 
automation solutions for business clients, for cash consideration of 
$ˆ˝million ($ˆ˝million net of cash acquired), of which $ˆ˜˝million is

objectives. This contingent consideration is expected to be settled 
by˝˜˚˜ and the maximum amount payable is $˝million. Contingent 
consideration is estimated to be nil at December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˛. 
On December˝ˆ, ˜˚˜˜, Bell acquired Distributel, a national independent 
communications provider offering a wide range of consumer, business 
and wholesale communications services, for cash consideration of 
$˛˚˛˝million ($˜˜˝million net of cash acquired) and $˛ˇ˝million of

estimated to be $ˇ million at December ˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˛ of which $ˆˇ million was 
paid in ˜˚˜˛. The remaining $˛˚˝million is expected to be paid in ˜˚˜. 
In February˝˜˚˜˜, Bell acquired EBOX and other related companies,

Debt instruments 
We use a combination of short-term and long-term debt to ˜nance our operations. Our short-term debt consists most ly of notes payable 
under commercial paper programs, loans securitized by receivables and wireless device ˜nancing plan receivables, and bank facilities. We 
usually pay ˜xed rates of interest on our long-term debt and ˙oating rates on our short-term debt . As at December˘ˆ˚, ˇˇˆ, all of our debt 
was denominated in Canadian dollars with the exception of our commercial paper, Bell Mobility trade loan

Fair value 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
at the measurement date. 
Certain fair value estimates are affected by assumptions we make about 
the amount and timing of future cash ows and discount rates, all of 
which reect varying degrees of risk. Income taxes and other expenses 
that may be incurred on disposition of ˙nancial instruments are not 
reected in the fair values. As a result , the fair values may not be the 
net amounts that would be realized if these instruments were sett led. 
The carrying values of our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, 
trade and other receivables, trade payables and other liabilities, interest 
payable, dividends payable, notes payable and loans secured by 
receivables approximate fair value as they are short-term. The carrying 
value of wireless device ˙nancing plan receivables approximates 
fair value given that their average remaining duration is short and 
the carrying value is reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts 
and an allowance for revenue adjustments. The carrying value of the 
Bell Mobility trade loans approximates fair value given their average 
remaining duration is short and they bear interest at a variable rate.

Credit ratings 
Credit ratings generally address the ability of a company to repay 
principal and pay interest on debt or dividends on issued and outstanding 
preferred shares. 
Our ability to raise ˜nancing depends on our ability to access the 
public equity and debt capital markets, the money market, as well as 
the bank credit market. Our ability to access such markets and the 
cost and amount of funding available part ly depend on our assigned 
credit ratings at the time capital is raised. Investment grade credit 
ratings usually mean that when we borrow money, we can obtain lower 
interest rates than companies that have ratings lower than investment 
grade. A ratings downgrade could result in adverse consequences for 
our funding cost and capacity, and our ability to access the capital 
markets, the money market and/or bank credit market . 
The following table provides BCE™s and Bell Canada™s credit ratings, which are considered investment grade, as at March˝,˝˜˚˜ from DBRS, 
Moody™s and S&P.

These credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any of the securities referred to, and they may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the assigning rating agency. 
 
Ratings are determined by the rating agencies based on criteria established from time to time by them, and they do not comment on market price or suitability for a particular investor. 
 
Each credit rating should be evaluated independently of any other credit rating. 
As of March˝, ˜˚˜, BCE™s and Bell Canada™s credit ratings have stable out looks from DBRS, Moody™s and S&P.

Liqu idity 
This section contains forward-looking statements, including relating to our anticipated capital expenditures, our expected post-employment 
bene˙t plans funding, and the sources of liquidity we expect to use to meet our ˜˚˜ cash requirements. Refer to the section 
Caution regarding 
forward-looking statements
 at the beginning of this MD& A. 
Available liquidity 
Total available liquidity at December˝˛ˆ,˝˜˚˜˛ was $.˝billion, comprised 
of $˝million in cash, $˜˜˝million in cash equivalents, $ˆ,˚˚˚˝million 
in short-term investments, $˚˚˝million available under our securitized 
receivables program and $˛.˛˝billion available under our $˛.˝billion 
committed revolving and expansion credit facilities (given $ˆˇ˝million 
of commercial paper outstanding). 
We expect that our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, 
amounts available under our securitized receivables program, cash ows 
from operations and possible capital markets ˙nancing will permit us 

to meet our cash requirements in˝˜˚˜ for capital expenditures, post-
employment bene˙t plans funding, dividend payments, the payment of 
contractual obligations, maturing debt, ongoing operations and other 

cash requirements. 
Should our˝˜˚˜ cash requirements exceed our cash, cash equivalents, 
short-term investments, cash generated from our operations, and funds 
raised under capital markets ˙nancings and our securitized receivables 
program, we would expect to cover such a shortfall by drawing under 
committed credit facilities that are current ly in place or through new 
facilities to the extent available. 
In ˜˚˜, our cash ows from operations, cash, cash equivalents, 
short-term investments, capital markets ˙nancings, securitized 
receivables program and credit facilities should give us exibility 
in carrying out our plans for business growth, including business 
acquisitions, as well as for the payment of contingencies. 
We continuously monitor our operations, capital markets and the 
Canadian economy with the objective of maintaining adequate liquidity. 
Securitization program 
In ˜˚˜˜, we entered into a new securitization program which replaced 
our previous securitized trade receivables program and now includes 
wireless device ˙nancing plan receivables. As a result , the maximum 
amount available under our securitization program increased from 
$ˆ.˛˝billion at December˝˛ˆ,˝˜˚˜ˆ to $˜.˛˝billion at December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˜. 
In ˜˚˜˛, we amended our securitization program to add sustainability-
linked pricing. The amendment introduces a ˙nancing cost that varies 
based on our performance of certain sustainability performance targets.

The securitization program is recorded as a oating rate revolving loan 
 
secured by certain receivables. We continue to service trade receivables 
 
and wireless device ˙nancing plan receivables under the securitization 
 
program, which matures in July˝˜˚˜ unless previously terminated. 
 
The lenders™ interest in the collection of these receivables ranks ahead 
 
of our interests, which means that we are exposed to certain risks of 
 
default on the amounts securitized. 
We have provided various credit enhancements in the form of 
 
overcollateralization and subordination of our retained interests. 
The lenders have no further claim on our other assets if customers do 
 
not pay the amounts owed. 
As of December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˛, the balance of loans secured by receivables 
 
was $ˆ.˜˝billion in U.S. dollars ($ˆ.˝billion in Canadian dollars) and 
 
the total receivable balance collateralized under the program was 
 
$˛.˛˝billion. The foreign currency risk on these loans is managed using 
 
foreign currency forward contracts. See section .,

Bell Canada may issue notes under its Canadian and U.S. commercial

$˛˝billion in either Canadian or U.S. currency provided that at no time 
shall such maximum amount of notes exceed $˛.˝billion in Canadian 
currency, which equals the aggregate amount available under Bell 
Canada™s committed supporting revolving and expansion credit facilities 
as at December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˛. The total amount of the net available committed 
revolving and expansion credit facilities may be drawn at any time. 
In ˜˚˜˛, Bell Mobility entered into a $˚˚˝million U.S. dollar uncommitted 
trade loan agreement to ˙nance certain purchase obligations. Loan 
requests may be made until April˝˛˚, ˜˚˜, with each loan having a 
term of up to ˜˝months. The loan agreement has been hedged for 
foreign currency uctuations. 
Some of our credit agreements require us to meet speci˙c ˙nancial 
ratios and to offer to repay and cancel the credit agreement upon a 
change of control of BCE or Bell Canada. In addition, some of our debt 
agreements require us to make an offer to repurchase certain series 
of debt securities upon the occurrence of a change of control event as 
de˙ned in the relevant debt agreements. We are in compliance with all 
conditions and restrictions under such agreements. 
Ca sh requirements 
Capital expenditures 
In ˜˚˜, our planned capital spending will be focused on our strategic 
imperatives, reecting an appropriate level of investment in our networks 
and services with a rollback of our ˙bre network expansion as a result 
of federal government policies and the CRTC™s decision in November 
˜˚˜˛ to mandate wholesale access to Bell™s FT TP network. 
Post-employment bene˜t plans funding 
Our post-employment bene˙t plans include DB pension and DC pension 
plans, as well as other post-employment bene˙ts (OPEBs) plans. The 
funding requirements of our post-employment bene˙t plans, resulting 
from valuations of our plan assets and liabilities, depend on a number 
of factors, including actual returns on post-employment bene˙t plan 
assets,long-term interest rates, plan demographics, and applicable 
regulationsand actuarialstandards.Actuarialvaluationswerelast 
performed for our signi˙cant post-employment bene˙t plans as at 
December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˜. 
We expect to contribute approximately $˝million to our DB pension 
plans in ˜˚˜, subject to actuarial valuations being completed. We expect 
to contribute approximately $ˆ˚˝million to the DC pension plans and to 
pay approximately $˚˝million to bene˙ciaries under OPEB plans in ˜˚˜.

We are also exposed to liquidity risk for ˙nancial liabilities due within

Our commitments for property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets include program and feature ˙lm rights and investments to 
expand and update our networks to meet customer demand. 
Purchase obligations consist of contractual obligations under service 
and product contracts for operating expenditures and other purchase 
obligations. 
Our commitments for leases not yet commenced include real estate, 
OOH advertising spaces and ˙bre use. These leases are non-cancellable. 
On October˝˜˛, ˜˚˜˛, Bell Media announced it plans to acquire the 
Canadian OOH media business of OUTFRONT Media˝Inc. The transaction 
is valued at $ˆ˚˝million, subject to certain adjustments, and is expected 
to close in the ˙rst half of ˜˚˜, subject to regulatory approval and 
other closing conditions. The acquisition of the Canadian OOH media 
business of OUTFRONT Media˝Inc. is expected to support Bell Media™s 
digital media strategy and to deliver impactful, multi-channel marketing 
solutions coast-to-coast . The results of the Canadian OOH business 
of OUTFRONT Media˝Inc. will be included in our Bell Media segment . 
Indemni˜cations and guarantees 
As a regular part of our business, we enter into agreements that provide 
for indemni˙cations and guarantees to counterparties in transactions 
involving business dispositions, sales of assets, sales of services, 
purchases and development of assets, securitization agreements and 
leases. While some of the agreements specify a maximum potential 
exposure, many do not specify a maximum amount or termination date. 
We cannot reasonably estimate the maximum potential amount we 
could be required to pay counterparties because of the nature of almost 
all of these indemni˙cations and guarantees. As a result , we cannot 
determine how they could affect our future liquidity, capital resources 
or credit risk pro˙le. We have not made any signi˙cant payments under 
indemni˙cations or guarantees in the past . 
. 
 
Litigation 
In the ordinary course of business, we become involved in various claims 
and legal proceedings seeking monetary damages and other relief. In 
particular, because of the nature of our consumer-facing business, we 
are exposed to class actions pursuant to which substantial monetary 
damages may be claimed. Due to the inherent risks and uncertainties 
of the litigation process, we cannot predict the ˙nal outcome or timing 
of claims and legal proceedings. Subject to the foregoing, and based on 
information currently available and management™s assessment of the 
merits of the claims and legal proceedings pending at March , ˜˚˜, 
management believes that the ultimate resolution of these claims and 
legal proceedings is unlikely to have a material and negative effect on 
our ˙nancial statements or operations. We believe that we have strong 
defences and we intend to vigorously defend our positions.

Total operating revenues at BCE
 increased by ˚.% in Q˝˜˚˜˛, 
compared to Q˝˜˚˜˜, driven by higher product revenues of ˛.%, 
moderated by a modest decline in service revenues of ˚.ˆ%, as the 
decline in Bell Media revenues was most ly offset by the growth in Bell 
CTS service revenues. Bell CTS operating revenues increased by ˆ.% 
year over year, attributable to both higher service revenues of ˆ.˜% 
and greater product revenue
s
 of ˛.%. The year-over-
year 
growth in 
service revenues reected greater wireless and wireline data revenues, 
moderated by ongoing declines in voice revenues. Bell Media operating 
revenues declined by .% year over year, driven by ongoing pressures 
in advertising revenues. 
BCE net earnings
 decreased by ˜˛.˛% in Q˝˜˚˜˛, compared to 
Q˝˜˚˜˜, mainly due to higher other expense, higher interest expense, 
higher depreciation and amortization and higher severance, acquisition 
and other costs, partly offset by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower 
impairment of assets. 
BCE™s adjusted EBITDA
 increased by .˛% in Q˝˜˚˜˛, compared to the 
same period last year, due to growth from both our Bell CTS and Bell 
Media segments of .% and ˆ.%, respectively. The year-over-year 
increase in adjusted EBITDA reected the ow-through of revenues, 
along with lower operating costs of ˜.%, mainly driven by Bell Media 
programming and content savings and the impact of various cost 
reduction initiatives and operating ef˙ciencies across the company. 
This resulted in a year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA margin 
of ˆ.ˇ˝pts, to ˛ˇ.% in Q˝˜˚˜˛. 
Bell CTS operating revenues
 grew by ˆ.% in Q˝˜˚˜˛, compared to 
the same period last year, driven by higher service revenue
s
 of ˆ.˜% 
from ongoing growth in our mobile phone, connected device, Internet 
and IPTV subscriber bases coupled with the ow-through of consumer 
rate increases, the contribution from acquisitions, mainly Distributel 
and FX Innovation, greater wireless roaming revenues and higher sales 
of business solutions services to large enterprise customers. This was 
moderated by increased acquisition, retention and bundle discounts on 
residential services, ongoing erosion in legacy voice, data and satellite TV 
services and lower wireless 
dataoverage
s 
driven by greater customer 
adoption of monthly plans with higher data thresholds. Additionally, 
product revenues increased by ˛.% year 
over 
year, mainly driven by 
higher wireless product revenues due to greater sales mix of premium 
mobile phones and lower year-over-year device discounting during 
the Black Friday and December holiday periods, moderated by lower 
contracted sales volumes and reduced consumer electronic sales at 
The Source. 
Bell CTS adjusted EBITDA 
increased by .% in Q˝˜˚˜˛, compared 
to Q˝ ˜˚˜˜, from greater year-over-year operating revenues, along 
with lower operating costs. The decline in operating costs of ˚.% 
reected various cost reduction initiatives and operating ef˙ciencies
, 
including workforce reductions. Adjusted EBITDA margin of ˜.ˆ% in 
Q˝˜˚˜˛, increased by ˆ.˜˝points over Q˝˜˚˜˜, mainly due to the 
impact of better promotional offer discipline during the Black Friday 
and December holiday sales periods this year compared to ˜˚˜˜, as 
well as higher year-over-year revenue ow-through and greater 
operating cost savings. 
Bell Media operating revenues
 decreased by .% in Q˝˜˚˜˛, compared 
to the same period last year, driven by lower advertising revenues, partly 
offset by higher subscriber revenues. The continued growth in digital 
revenues of ˜% moderated the overall decline in operating revenues. 
Advertising revenues decreased by ˆ˛.% in Q˝˜˚˜˛, compared to 
Q˝˜˚˜˜, due to lower demand from advertisers as a result of ongoing 
unfavourable economic conditions, which negatively impacted revenues 
across our TV and radio platforms. TV advertising revenues were also 
unfavourably impacted by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes and the 
bene˙t last year from the broadcast of the FIFA World Cup Qatar ˜˚˜˜
. 
The decline in advertising revenues was partly offset by continued 
growth indigital advertisingrevenues,mainlydrivenbyincreased 
bookings from Bell Media™s SAM TV media sales tool. Subscriber revenues 
increased by ˆ.˚% in Q˝˜˚˜˛, compared to the same period last year, 
due to a one-time retroactive adjustment related to a contract with a 
Canadian TV distributor. 
Bell Media adjusted EBITDA
 increased by ˆ.% in Q˝˜˚˜˛, compared 
to the same period last year, as lower operating costs more than 
offset the decline in operating revenues. The decrease in operating 
costs was mainly attributable to lower content and programming 
costs due to higher costs in Q˝˜˚˜˜˝related to the broadcast of the 
FIFA World Cup Qatar ˜˚
˜˜
, and content delays in Q ˜˚˜˛ due to the 
WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, partly offset by ongoing contractual 
increases in content costs. Additionally, the year-over-year decline 
in operating costs 
reected 
lower labour costs due to restructuring 
initiatives undertaken as a result of the unfavourable economic and 
broadcasting regulatory environments and the cessation of the CRTC 
Part II broadcasting licen
c
e fee. 
BCE capital expenditures
 of $ˆ,˚˜ˇ˝million in Q˝˜˚˜˛, declined by 
$˚ˇ˝million or ˛.˜%, compared to the same period last year. This 
corresponded to a capital intensity ratio of ˆ.ˇ%, down ˇ.˝pts over 
Q˝˜˚˜˜. The decrease in capital expenditures was driven by lower 
capital spending in Bell CTS of $˝million, due to lower planned 
spending in˝˜˚˜˛ subsequent to accelerated network investments in 
˜˚˜˜, along with an unplanned additional $ˆ˚˝million decrease in Q 

˜˚˜˛ 
as a result of the CRTC™s decision in November˝˜˚˜˛ to mandate 
wholesale access to Bell™s FTTP network. Bell Media capital expenditures 
in Q ˜˚˜˛ also declined year
-
over
-
year by $˜ million, due to greater 
spending in Q˝˜˚˜˜˝on studio expansions and timing of investments 
to support digital growth. 
BCE severance, acquisition and other costs
 of $ˆ˝million in Q˝˜˚˜˛ 
increased by $˜˜˝million, compared to Q˝˜˚˜˜, mainly due to higher 
acquisition and other costs, part ly offset by lower severance costs 
related to involuntary and voluntary employee terminations. 
BCE depreciation
 of $ˇ˝million in Q˝˜˚˜˛˝increased by $˛˜˝million, 
year over year, mainly due to a higher asset base as we continued to 
invest in our broadband and wireless networks. 
BCE amortization
 of $˜ˇˇ˝million in Q˝˜˚˜˛˝increased by $˜ˇ˝million, 
year over year, mainly due to a higher asset base. 
BCE interest expense
 of $˛ˇˇ˝million in Q˝˜˚˜˛˝increased by 
$˚˝million, compared to Q˝˜˚˜˜, mainly due to higher average debt 
balances and higher average interest rates. 
BCE impairment of assets
 of $ˆ˚ˇ˝million in Q˝˜˚˜˛˝decreased by 
$ˆ million, compared to Q ˜˚˜˜, mainly due to lower impairment 
charges for French TV channels within our Bell Media segment .

BCE other expense
 of $ˆ˝million in Q˝˜˚˜˛˝increased by $ˆ˝million, 
year over year, mainly due to losses on our equity investments in 
associates and joint ventures which included a loss on BCE™s share of 
an obligation to repurchase at fair value the minority interest in one of 
BCE™s joint ventures, part ly offset by higher interest income. 
BCE income taxes
 of $˜ˆ˚˝million in Q˝˜˚˜˛˝decreased by $ˆ˜˝million, 
compared to Q˝˜˚˜˜, mainly due to a higher value of uncertain tax 
positions favourably resolved in˝˜˚˜˛ compared to ˜˚˜˜, partly offset 
by higher taxable income. 
BCE net earnings attributable to common shareholders
 of $˛˜˝million 
in Q˝˜˚˜˛, or $˚.˜˝per share, were lower than the $˜˝ million, or 
$˚.˝per share, reported in Q˝˜˚˜˜. The year-over-year decrease 
was mainly due to higher other expense, higher interest expense, 
higher depreciation and amortization and higher severance, acquisition 
and other costs, partly offset by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower 
impairment of assets. Adjusted net earnings increased to $ˇˆ˝million 
in Q˝ ˜˚˜˛, compared to $˝ million in Q˝ ˜˚˜˜, and adjusted EPS 

increased to $˚.˝from $˚.ˆ˝in Q˝˜˚˜˜. 
BCE cash ows from operating activities 
was $˜,˛˛˝million in 
Q˝˜˚˜˛˝compared to $˜,˚˝million in Q˝˜˚˜˜. The increase was 
mainly attributed to lower income taxes paid, higher cash from working 
capital and higher adjusted EBITDA, partly offset by higher interest paid. 
BCE free cash ow
 generated in Q˝˜˚˜˛˝was $ˆ,˜ˇ˝million, compared 
to $˛˝million in Q˝˜˚˜˜. The increase was mainly attributable to lower 
capital expenditures and higher cash ows from operating activities, 

excluding acquisition and other costs paid. 
Seasonality considerations 
Some of our revenues and expenses vary slight ly by season, which 
may impact quarter-to-quarter ˙nancial results. 
Wireless 
service and product revenues are inuenced by the timing of 
new mobile device launches and seasonal promotional periods, such as 
back-to-school, Black Friday and the Christmas holiday period, as well 
as the level of overall competitive intensity. Because of these seasonal 
effects, subscriber additions and retention costs due to device upgrades 
related to contract renewals are typically higher in the third and fourth 
quarters. For ARPU, historically we have experienced seasonal sequential 
increases in the second and third quarters, due to higher levels of usage 
and roaming in the spring and summer months, followed by historical 
seasonal sequential declines in the fourth and ˙rst quarters. However, 
this seasonal effect on ARPU has moderated, as unlimited voice and 
data options have become more prevalent, resulting in less variability 
in chargeable data usage. 
Wireline 
service and product revenues tend to be higher in the fourth 
quarter because of historically higher data and equipment product 
sales to business customers. However, this may vary from year to 
year depending on the strength of the economy and the presence 
of targeted sales initiatives, which can inuence customer spending. 
Home Phone, TV and Internet subscriber activity is subject to modest 
seasonal uctuations, attributable largely to residential moves during 
the summer months and the back-to-school period in the third quarter. 
Targeted marketing efforts conducted during various times of the year to 
coincide with special events or broad-based marketing campaigns also 
may have an impact on overall wireline service and product revenues
. 
Bell Media
 revenue and related expenses from TV and radio broadcasting 
are largely derived from the sale of advertising, the demand for which 
is affected by prevailing economic conditions as well as cyclical and 
seasonal variations. Seasonal variations in TV are driven by the strength 
of TV ratings, particularly during the fall programming season, major 
sports league seasons and other special sporting events such as the 
Olympic Games, National Hockey League (NHL) and NBA playoffs 
and FIFA World Cup soccer, as well as uctuations in consumer retail 

activity during the year.

Introduction 
This section describes certain legislation that governs our business and 
provides highlights of recent regulatory initiatives and proceedings, 
government consultations and government positions that affect us, 
inuence our business and may continue to affect our ability to compete 
in the marketplace. Bell Canada and several of its direct and indirect 
subsidiaries, including Bell Mobility, Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership 
(ExpressVu), Bell Media, NorthernTel, Limited Partnership (NorthernTel), 
Télébec, Limited Partnership (Télébec), Group Maskatel Québec LP 
(Maskatel) and Northwestel, are governed by the 
Telecommunications 
Act
, the 
Broadcasting Act
, the 
Radiocommunication Act
 and/or the 
Bell Canada Act
. Our business is affected by regulations, policies and 
decisions made by various regulatory agencies, including the CRTC, a 
quasi-judicial agency of the Government of Canada responsible for 
regulating Canada™s telecommunications and broadcasting industries, 
and other federal government departments, in particular ISED and the 
Competition Bureau. 
In particular, the CRTC regulates the prices we can charge for retail 
telecommunications services when it determines there is not enough 
competition to protect the interests of consumers. The CRTC has 
determined that competition is suf˙cient to grant forbearance from 
retail price regulation under the 
Telecommunications Act
 for the 
vast majority of our retail wireline and wireless telecommunications 
services. The CRTC can also mandate the provision of access by 
competitors to our wireline and wireless networks and the rates we 
can charge them. Notably, it currently mandates wholesale high-speed 
access for wireline broadband as well as domestic wireless roaming 
services and a wholesale facilities-based MVNO access service. Lower 
mandated wholesale rates or the imposition of unfavourable terms 
for mandated services 
would 
undermine our incentives to invest in 
network improvements and extensions, limit our exibility, inuence the 
market structure, improve the business position of our competitors, limit 
network-based differentiation of our services and negatively impact 
the ˙nancial performance of our businesses. Our TV distribution and our 
TV and radio broadcasting businesses are subject to the 
Broadcasting 
Act
 and are, for the most part , not subject to retail price regulation. 
Although most of our retail services are not price-regulated, government 
agencies and departments such as the CRTC, ISED, Canadian Heritage 
and the Competition Bureau continue to play a signi˙cant role in 
regulatory matters such as establishing and modifying regulations for 
mandatory access to networks, spectrum auctions, the imposition of 
consumer-related codes ofconduct,approval ofacquisitions,broadcast 
and spectrum licensing, foreign ownership requirements, privacy and 
cybersecurity obligations, and control of copyright piracy. Adverse 
decisions by governments or regulatory agencies, increasing regulation 
or a lack of effective anti-piracy remedies could have negative ˙nancial, 
operational, reputational or competitive consequences for our business. 
.˜ 
 
Telecommunications Act 
The 
Telecommunications Act
 governs telecommunications in Canada. 
It de˙nes the broad objectives of Canada™s telecommunications policy 
and provides the Government of Canada with the power to give general 
direction to the CRTC on any of its policy objectives. It applies to several 
of the BCE group of companies and partnerships, including Bell Canada, 
Bell Mobility, NorthernTel, Télébec, Maskatel and Northwestel. 
Under the 
Telecommunications Act
, all facilities-based telecommuni
cations service providers in Canada, known as telecommunications 
common carriers (TCCs), must seek regulatory approval for all telecom
munications services, unless the services are exempt or forborne from 
regulation. Most retail services offered by the BCE group of companies 
are forborne from retail regulation. The CRTC may exempt an entire 
class of carriers from regulation under the 
Telecommunications Act
 if 
the exemption meets the objectives of Canada™s telecommunications 
policy. In addition, a few large TCCs, including those in the BCE group, 
must alsomeetcertain Canadian ownershiprequirements. BCE monitors 
and periodically reports on the level of non-Canadian ownership of its 
common shares. 
Review of mobile wireless services 
On April˝ˆ, ˜˚˜ˆ, the CRTC released a decision requiring Bell Mobility, 
Rogers Communications Canada˝Inc., Telus Communications˝Inc. and 
Saskatchewan Telecommunications (SaskTel) to provide MVNO access 
to their networks to regional wireless carriers to allow them to operate 
as MVNOs in ISED Tier ˝spectrum licence areas where they own 
spectrum. While the terms and conditions for MVNO access would be 
established in tariffs to be approved by the CRTC, the rate for MVNO 
access would not be subject to the CRTC tariff regime but instead be 
commercially negotiated between the parties with ˙nal offer arbitration 
(FOA) by the CRTC as a recourse if negotiations fail. The CRTC indicated 
that the mandated access service is intended to be a temporary 
measure and will, in the absence of certain implementation delays, be 
phased out seven years from the date tariffed terms and conditions 
are ˙nalized. In the decision, the CRTC has also required Bell Mobility, 
Rogers
 Communications Canada Inc. and Telus Communications Inc. 
to provide seamless handoffs as part of the CRTC™s existing mandated 
domestic roaming service and has con˙rmed that its mandatory 
roaming obligations apply to G. On July˝ˆ, ˜˚˜ˆ, Bell Mobility, Rogers 
Communications Canada Inc., Telus Communications Inc. and SaskTel 
˙led proposed tariff terms and conditions for the mandated MVNO 
access service and Bell Mobility, Rogers Communications Canada Inc. 

and Telus Communications Inc. ˙led proposed amendments to their 
mandated roaming tariffs to reect the CRTC™s determinations. On 
April˝, ˜˚˜˜, the CRTC issued a decision on the mandated roaming 
tariffs in which it directed Bell Mobility, Rogers Communications Canada 
Inc. 
and Telus Communications Inc. to make speci˙ed changes to their 
tariffs by April˝˜ˆ, ˜˚˜˜, for CRTC approval.

On October˝ˆˇ, ˜˚˜˜, the CRTC issued a decision in which it made certain 
determinations regarding the terms and conditions of the proposed 
MVNO tariffs previously ˙led by Bell Mobility, Rogers Communications 
Canada Inc. , Telus  Communications Inc.  and SaskTel, and directed them 
to ˙le revised tariffs reecting these determinations within ˛˚˝days. In 
the decision, the CRTC directed Bell Mobility, Rogers Communications 
Canada Inc., Telus Communications Inc. and SaskTel to offer MVNO 
access service to regional carriers with a home radio access network 
(RAN) and core network actively offering mobile wireless services 
commercially to retail customers in Canada, and con˙rmed that similar 
terms and conditions related to seamless handoffs and G in the 
domestic roaming tariffs should apply to the mandated MVNO tariffs. 
The CRTC required Bell Mobility, Rogers Communications Canada Inc.
, 
Telus
 Communications Inc. and SaskTel to begin accepting requests 
for MVNO access from regional wireless carriers from the date of the 
decision. Bell Mobility is required to provide access to the mandated 
MVNO service in all provinces (excluding Saskatchewan) and in the three 
territories. It is unclear at this time what impact , if any, the measures 
set out in this decision could have on our business and ˙nancial results, 
and our ability to make investments at the same levels as we have in 
the past. In Q˛˝ ˜˚˜˛, we began providing MVNO access service on 
Bell Mobility™s network in certain regions and expect that use of the 
service on our network by our wholesale customers will continue to 
expand in the future. 
On July˝ˆ˛, ˜˚˜˛, the CRTC accepted a request fromQuébecor Media˝Inc. 
to initiate FOA in respect of rates for MVNO access service from Bell 
Mobility. Following the parties™ submissions in August˝˜˚˜˛, the CRTC 
issued a decision on October˝ˆ˚, ˜˚˜˛, selecting the rate proposed by 
Bell Mobility. On December˝ˆ, ˜˚˜˛, Québecor Media Inc. 
subsequently 
˙led a Part ˆ application seeking the CRTC™s intervention in determining 
the start date for the MVNO access service from Bell Mobility. Bell Mobility 
˙led its responding submission on January˝ˆˇ, ˜˚˜. 
The CRTC previously accepted a joint request for FOA from Rogers 
Communications Canada Inc. 
and
 Québecor Media Inc. On July˝˜, 
˜˚˜˛, the CRTC issued its decision in that arbitration, selecting the rate 
proposed by Québecor Media Inc. In the decision, the CRTC made a 
number of ˙ndings or determinations that indicate a continued trend 
toward downplaying the importance of incentives for investment in 
telecommunications networks in Canada. While the CRTC™s determination 
in Bell Mobility™s FOA with Québecor Media Inc appears to have 
moderated this approach by highlighting the importance of providing 
a return on investment to facilities-based carriers, adverse regulatory 
decisionssuch as the Rogers Communications Canada Inc. 
andQuébecor 
Media Inc FOA decision are expected to impact the speci˙c nature, 
magnitude, location and timing of our future wireless and wireline 
investment decisions. On August˝˜˛, ˜˚˜˛, Rogers 
Communications 
Canada Inc.sought leave to appeal the CRTC™s arbitration decision with 
the Federal Court of Appeal. 
Review of wholesale FTTN high-speed access
service rates 
As part of its ongoing review of wholesale Internet rates, on October˝, 
˜˚ˆ, the CRTC signi˙cant ly reduced, on an interim basis, some of the 
wholesale rates that Bell Canada and other major providers charge for 
access by third-party Internet resellers to FT TN or cable networks, as 
applicable. On August˝ˆ, ˜˚ˆˇ, the CRTC further reduced the wholesale 
rates that Internet resellers pay to access network infrastructure built 
by facilities-based providers like Bell Canada, with retroactive effect 
to March˝˜˚ˆ. 
The August ˜˚ˆˇ decision was stayed, ˙rst by the Federal Court of 
Appeal and then by the CRTC, with the result that it never came into 
effect. In response to review and vary applications ˙led by each of Bell 
Canada, ˙ve major cable carriers (Cogeco Communications Inc., 
Eastlink
, 
Rogers
 Communications Canada Inc., Shaw and Vidéotron) and Telus 
Communications Inc., the CRTC issued Decision ˜˚˜ˆ-ˆ˜˝on May˝˜, 
˜˚˜ˆ, which mostly reinstated the rates prevailing prior to August ˜˚ˆˇ 
with some reductions to the Bell Canada rates with retroactive effect 
to March˝˜˚ˆ. As a result, in the second quarter of ˜˚˜ˆ, we recorded 
a reduction in revenue of $˝million in our consolidated income 
statements. 
While there remains a requirement to refund monies to third-party 
Internet resellers, the establishment of ˙nal wholesale rates that 
are similar to those prevailing since˝˜˚ˆˇ reduces the impact of the 
CRTC™s long-running review of wholesale Internet rates. The largest 
reseller, TekSavvy Solutions˝Inc. (TekSavvy), obtained leave to appeal 
the CRTC™s decision of May˝˜,˝˜˚˜ˆ before the Federal Court of Appeal. 
Oral hearings are now complete and we are awaiting a decision of the 
court. The decision was also challenged in three petitions brought by 
TekSavvy, Canadian Network Operators Consortium˝Inc. and National 
Capital Freenet before Cabinet but, on May˝˜, ˜˚˜˜, Cabinet announced 
it would not alter the decision. 
Review of the wholesale high-speed access

service framework 
On March˝, ˜˚˜˛, the CRTC launched a consultation, TNC ˜˚˜˛-, 
to review the wholesale high-speed access framework. The CRTC 
expressed the preliminary views that (i) the provision of aggregated 
wholesale high-speed access services should be mandated, including 
over FT TP facilities, and (ii) aggregated access to FT TP facilities should be 
mandated on a temporary and expedited basis, until the CRTC reaches 
a decision as to whether such access is to be provided inde˙nitely. 
The review is also notably seeking comments on (i) the future of 
disaggregated high-speed access services, (ii) the state of competition 
in the retail Internet service market , (iii) whether other changes are 
required to support wholesale-based competition across all regions 
of the country, (iv) whether wholesale regulation should continue to 
be relied upon to address concerns regarding market concentration 
and the potential exercise of market power, and (v) whether the CRTC 
should consider any type of retail regulation. 
On November˝, ˜˚˜˛, in Telecom Decision CRTC ˜˚˜˛-˛˝(the Decision), 
the CRTC determined that aggregated access to Bell Canada™s FT TP 

facilities in Ontario and Qu
 é
bec should be mandated on a temporary 
and expedited basis, and the CRTC set interim access rates. The CRTC 

may maintain, reverse or otherwise modify this new obligation when 
it concludes its ongoing wholesale high-speed access review. 
The imposition of an interim aggregated access to FTTP facilities 
obligation has undermined Bell Canada™s incentives to invest in next-
generation wireline networks and is expected to adversely impact our 
˙nancial results. Bell Canada announced its intention to reduce capital 
expenditures by over $ˆ billion 
over
 ˜˚˜ and ˜˚˜ combined, including 
a minimum of $˚˚˝million in ˜˚˜, and roll back ˙bre network expansion 
to a near-term target of .˛ million locations by the end of ˜˚˜ as a 
result of federal government policies and the Decision. Bell Canada 
is 

also capping ˙bre speeds at ˛ Gbps. In Q˝˜˚˜˛, Bell Canada reduced 
its capital investment by $ˆ˚˝million more than originally planned as 
a result of the Decision.

resolution of its appeal. On February ˇ, ˜˚˜, the Federal Court of 
Appeal granted Bell Canada leave to appeal but declined to grant the 
requested stay. On February˝˜, ˜˚˜, Bell Canada ˙led an appeal to 
the Governor-in-Council. 
Additionally, on February ˆ, ˜˚˜, CIK Telecom ˙led an application with 
the CRTC asking that the CRTC clarify or vary the intended scope of 

the Decision to: (ˆ) prevent Bell Canada, Rogers Communications˝Inc., 
Québecor Media Inc. and Telus Communications Inc. from accessing 
aggregated FT TP facilities pursuant to 
the 
Decision, and (˜) lower the 
interim rates set in the Decision. In a letter dated March , ˜˚˜, the 
CRTC stated that the changes CIK Telecom sought will be considered 
in the ˙nal decision and thus closed the application. 
Review of the CRTC™s regulatory framework 
for˚Northwestel 
On June˝, ˜˚˜˜, the CRTC launched the second phase of a proceeding 
to review the regulatory framework for Northwestel and the state 
of telecommunications services in Canada™s North. This proceeding 
may result in modi˙cations to the current regulatory framework for 
Northwestel, including with respect to issues such as rates, wholesale 
access and subsidies. Modi˙cations to the current regulatory framework 
may result in additional subsidies and rate exibility for Northwestel, 
which would encourage investment, or they may result in rate reductions/ 
restrictions or additional wholesale obligations, which would undermine 
incentives for investment in the North. At this time, it is unclear what 
impact, if any, the results of the proceeding could have on our business 
and ˙nancial results. 
CRTC review of access to poles 
On February˝ˆ, ˜˚˜˛, the CRTC issued a decision which included a 
number of determinations to facilitate access by third parties to poles 
owned by Canadian carriers or poles to which Canadian carriers control 
access. Among other directions, the CRTC™s decision: establishes new 
timelines for each step in the pole access permitting process; reduces 
the obligations of access seekers to pay costs for any pole repairs, 
upgrades or replacements required to accommodate the addition of 
the access seeker™s equipment; provides access seekers with greater 
exibility to carry out pole repairs and upgrades themselves; maintains 
the circumstances under which pole owners may obtain priority access 
to poles or reserve capacity for their future use on poles; and imposes 
new noti˙cation and reporting obligations on pole owners. On April˝˛, 
˜˚˜˛, large ILECs, including Bell Canada, updated their applicable 
tariffs to incorporate the new determinations and are awaiting the 
CRTC™s approval.

Bill C-˛, An Act Respecting Cyber Security 
On June˝ˆ, ˜˚˜˜, the Government of Canada introduced Bill C-˜, 
An Act 
Respecting Cyber Security
 (ARCS). ARCS would enact the 
Critical Cyber 
Systems Protection Act
, which would establish a regulatory framework 
requiring designated operators in the ˙nance, telecommunications, 
energy and transportation sectors to protect their critical cyber 
systems. Also included in Bill C-˜˝are proposed changes to the 
Telecommunications Act 
that would establish new authorities that would 
enable the Government to take action to promote the security of the 
Canadian telecommunications system, which could include measures 
with respect to certain suppliers, such as Huawei and ZTE. If enacted, 
Bill C-˜˝would give the Minister responsible for ISED additional order-
making powers and establish an enforcement regime under which the 
Minister responsible for ISED could impose administrative monetary 
penalties, among other actions. It is unclear at this time what impact 
the legislative changes could have on our business and ˙nancial results. 
Canada™s telecommunications foreign
ownership˚rules 
Under the 
Telecommunications Act
, there are no foreign investment 
restrictions applicable to TCCs that have less than a ˆ˚% share of the total 
Canadian telecommunications market as measured by annual revenues. 
However, foreign investment in telecommunications companies can still 
be refused by the government under the 
Investment Canada Act
. The 
absence of foreign ownership restrictions on such small or new entrant 
TCCs could result in more foreign companies entering the Canadian 
market , including by acquiring spectrum licences or Canadian TCCs. 
.˛ 
 
Broadcasting Act 
The 
Broadcasting Act
 outlines the broad objectives of Canada™s 
broadcasting policy and assigns the regulation and supervision of 
the broadcasting system to the CRTC. Key policy objectives of the 
Broadcasting Act
 are to protect and strengthen the cultural, political, 
social and economic fabric of Canada and to encourage the development 
of Canadian expression. 
Most broadcasting activities require a programming or distribution 
licence from the CRTC. The CRTC may exempt broadcasting undertakings 
from complying with certain licensing and regulatory requirements 
if it is satis˙ed that non-compliance will not materially affect the 
implementation of Canadian broadcasting policy. A corporation must 
also meet certain Canadian ownership and control requirements to 
obtain a programming or distribution licence, and corporations must 
have the CRTC™s approval before they can transfer effective control of 
a broadcasting licensee. 
Our TV distribution operations and our TV and radio broadcasting 
operations are subject to the requirements of the 
Broadcasting Act
, the 
policies and decisions of the CRTC and their respective broadcasting 
licences. Any changes in the 
Broadcasting Act
, amendments to 
regulations or the adoption of new ones, or amendments to licences, 
could negatively affect our competitive position or the cost of providing 
services.

Bill C-ˇˇ, An Act to amend the Broadcasting Act 
On April˝˜, ˜˚˜˛, Bill C-ˆˆ, 
An Act to amend the Broadcasting Act and to 
make related and consequential amendments to other Acts
, received 
royal assent . Key among the amendments in Bill C-ˆˆ˝is the immediate 
elimination of CRTC Part II Licence Fees whereby the broadcasting 
industry paid an annual tax of approximately $ˆ˜ million per year. 
In addition, foreign online broadcasting undertakings doing business˝in 
Canada will be required to contribute to the Canadian broadcasting 
system in a manner that the CRTC deems appropriate. The speci˙cs 
of such contributions will be determined through the CRTC™s public 
consultation processes and enforced by way of conditions imposed 
by the CRTC. The timing and the outcome of the CRTC™s consultation 
processes, the ˙rst stage of which was launched on May˝ˆ˜,˝˜˚˜˛ (as 
discussed under 
 Broadcast Notice of Consultation
  ˜˚˜˛-ˆ˛˝below) 
are 
unknown; therefore the impact that these regulatory changes 
could have on our business and ˙nancial results is unclear at this time. 
Broadcast Notice of Consultation CRTC ˛˝˛˙-ˇ˙ 
On May ˆ˜, ˜˚˜˛, the CRTC issued Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 
CRTC ˜˚˜˛-ˆ˛, 
The Path Forward Œ Working towards a modernized 
regulatory framework regarding the contributions to support Canadian 
and Indigenous content
. This Notice represents the ˙rst of three 
steps to develop an updated regulatory framework for broadcasting 
undertakings, including online undertakings. A key part of this new 
framework is to establish the conditions under which online services 
would be required to make ˙nancial contributions, including initial base 
contributions, to support the creation and discoverability of Canadian 
and Indigenous content . It will also determine who the recipients of the 
initial base contributions will be. The CRTC held a three-week hearing 
beginning on November˝˜˚,˝˜˚˜˛ to focus on these issues. While the 
CRTC has not yet initiated its public consultations for Steps ˜˝and ˛, 
these subsequent proceedings will focus on the overall framework 
for both traditional and online undertakings, with a focus on how to 
support the creation of Canadian and Indigenous content beyond 
˙nancial contribution requirements, as well as diversity, inclusion 
and discoverability issues. In Step ˛, the CRTC intends to ˙nalize 
each undertaking™s or ownership group™s contribution requirements, 
presumably as part of our group licence renewal. The timing and 
outcome of all of these proceedings, including the CRTC™s Step ˆ˝decision, 
is unknown. Therefore, the impact that these regulatory changes could 
have on our business and ˙nancial results is unclear at this time. 
Broadcast Policy Direction 
On November˝ˆ, ˜˚˜˛, the Government of Canada released its Policy 
Direction, which directs the CRTC on how to implement the amendments 
to the 
Broadcasting Act
 (Bill C-ˆˆ). The Direction requires the CRTC to focus 
on ensuring strong support for Canadian and Indigenous programming, 
as well as to consider the importance of sustainable support for local 
and regional news by the Canadian broadcasting system. In addition, 
the Direction requires the CRTC to minimize the regulatory burden 
on the Canadian broadcasting system, and to consider how to foster 
collaboration between Canadian and foreign undertakings. At this 
time, it is unclear what impact , if any, the Direction could have on our 
business and ˙nancial results.

Radiocommunication Act 
ISED regulates the use of radio spectrum under the 
Radiocommu
nication Act
 and 
Radiocommunication Regulations
 to ensure that 
radiocommunication in Canada is developed and operated ef˙ciently. 
All companies wishing to operate radio apparatus in Canada must hold 
a radio licence or spectrum licence to do so. The 
Radiocommunication 
Regulations
 specify those persons (including corporations such as Bell 
Canada and Bell Mobility) who are eligible to be issued radio licences 
or spectrum licences. 
˙˝˝˚MHz spectrum auction 
The auction for licensing˝˛˚˚ MHz spectrum began on October˝˜,˝˜˚˜˛ 
 
and the provisional spectrum licence winners were announced 
 
by ISED on November˝˛˚, ˜˚˜˛. Bell Mobility secured the right to 
 
acquire ˇ˛ˇ˝licences of ˛˚˚˝MHz spectrum across Canada covering 
 
ˆ.˝ billion MHz-Pop for $ˆ˝million. As part of this auction, ISED 
 
implemented a cross-band spectrum cap (with the˝˛˚˚ MHz band) of 
 
ˆ˚˚˝MHz. The auctioned licences will have a ˜˚-year term and licences 
 
will not be transferable for the ˙rst 
˙ve 
years of the licence term if the 
transfer results in exceeding the cross-band spectrum cap. In addition, 
licensees will be required to provide network coverage to a certain 
percentage of the population at , , ˆ˚˝and ˜˚˝years following licence 
issuance depending on the licence area. Licensees with existing LTE 
networks will be subject to additional deployment requirements based 
on their existing LTE coverage. Bell Mobility™s initial auction payment 
representing ˜˚% of the total payment was made on January˝ˆ, ˜˚˜. 
The remaining ˚% representing the ˙nal auction payment is due on 
May˝˜ˇ, ˜˚˜, at which time ISED will issue the˝˛˚˚ MHz spectrum 
licences. 
Consultation on ˛, ˛˚and ˙˚GHz (Millimeter
Wave) spectrum licensing framework 
On June˝, ˜˚˜˜, ISED initiated a consultation seeking input regarding 
a policy and licensing framework to govern the auction and use of 
spectrum licences in the ˜, ˜˝and ˛˝Gigahertz (GHz) (Millimeter Wave) 
spectrum bands. The consultation paper seeks comments on the use 
of a spectrum set-aside for certain auction bidders, or a spectrum cap 
across the ˜, ˜˝and ˛˝GHz spectrum bands. ISED proposes that the 
auctioned licences will have a ˆ˚-year term and that there will be limits 
on the extent of transferability of licences for the ˙rst ˙ve years of the 
licence term. In addition, ISED proposes that licensees will be required 
to deploy a certain number of sites in each licence area at ˙ve and nine 
and a half years following licence issuance. ISED has not yet indicated 
a speci˙c date when the auction will take place. The consultation paper 
also seeks comments on the transition process for existing ˛˝GHz 
licensees from ˙xed to exible use (i.e., mobile or ˙xed use), as well as 
the limitations on the use of ˛˝GHz spectrum by satellite earth stations. 
It is unclear what impact the results of this consultation and future 
related processes could have on our business and ˙nancial results.

Bill C-ˇ, the Online News Act 
On June˝˜˜, ˜˚˜˛, Bill C-ˆ, 
An Act respecting online communications 
platforms that make news content available to persons in Canada
 (the 
Online News Act) received royal assent . The Online News Act requires 
digital news intermediaries, such as Google and Meta, that share news 
content produced by other news outlets to negotiate commercial 
arrangements with those outlets, compensating them for the news 
content shared on digital platforms. The legislation entitles Bell Media™s 
general news services, such as CTV and Noovo, to compensation. 
Further details regarding the compensation framework have been 
set out in Regulations that were released on December ˆ, ˜˚˜˛. These 
Regulations clarify that the Online News Act applies to search engines 
and social media sites that provide access to news content in Canada 
provided these platforms earn at least Cdn $ˆ˝billion in annual global 
revenue and reach at least ˜˚˝million Canadians on a monthly basis. 
In addition, the total amount of compensation to be provided by the 
largest platform(i.e., Google) 
is limited to $ˆ˚˚˝million annually, and 
compensation provided by other platforms will be determined by the 
CRTC based on the platform™s Canadian advertising revenues. Of these 
amounts, private broadcasters cannot receive more than ˛˚% of the 
overall compensation available. The amount of compensation that 
Bell Media may receive from Google is unclear, as is the timing of such 
compensation. It is also unknown whether Meta will stop blocking news 
links and subject themselves to the jurisdiction of the Online News Act. 
While Meta™s actions are having some negative impact on our news sites, 
the full impact that the legislative changes could have on our business 
and ˙nancial results is unknown at this time. Finally, the CRTC must still 
establish its processes to administer the Online News Act .

Customer experience 
Our 
 
networks 
Our customers 
 
and˝relationships 
 
Our˝products 
 
and services 
Driving a positive customer experience in all aspects of our 
engagement with customers is important to avoid brand degradation 
and other adverse impacts on our business and ˜nancial performance 
As the bar continues to be raised by customers™ evolving expectations of 
service and value, failure to get ahead of such expectations and build a 
more robust and consistent service experience at a fair value proposition 
could hinder product and service differentiation and customer loyalty. 
The foundation of effective customer service is the ability to deliver high-
quality, consistent and simple solutions to customers in an expeditious 
manner and on mutually agreeable terms. Although we seek to reduce 
complexity in our operations through our transformation initiatives, 
we operate with multiple technology platforms, ordering and billing 
systems, sales channels, marketing databases and a myriad of rate 
plans, promotions, brands and product offerings, in the context of a 
large customer base and a workforce that continuously requires to 
be trained, monitored and replaced, which may limit our ability to 
respond quickly to market changes and reduce costs, and may lead 
to customer confusion or billing, service or other errors, which could 
adversely affect customer satisfaction, acquisition and retention. Media 
attention to customer complaints could also erode our brand and 
reputation and adversely affect customer acquisition and retention. In 
addition, the current global economic environment may bring about 
further workforce reduction initiatives or limit investments, which could 
negatively impact the rapidity of our response to customer demands 

and the overall customer experience. 
With the proliferation of connectivity services, apps and devices, 
customers are accustomed to doing things when, how and where they 
want through websites, self-serve options, web chat , call centres and 
social media forums. These customer demands have intensi˙ed since 
the beginning of the COVID-ˆˇ˝pandemic and the resulting shift to 
online transactions, and we seek to provide the necessary platforms 
for customers to research, interact, purchase and receive service. 
Customers™ journey is increasingly completed on mobile devices, 
requiring alignment of websites, customer support platforms and 
marketing. Understanding the customer relationship as a whole in a 
multi-product environment and delivering a simple, seamless experience 
at a fair price is increasingly central to an evolving competitive dynamic. 
While we 
have 
introduced new services and tools, including self-
managed solutions, designed to accelerate our customer experience 
evolution, we are unable to predict whether such services and tools 
will be suf˙cient to meet customer expectations. Failure to develop true 
omni-channel capabilities and improve our customer experience by 
digitizing and developing a consistent, fast and on-demand end-to-end 
experience before, during and after sales using new technologies such 
as AI and machine learning, in parallel with our network evolution, could 
also adversely affect our business, ˙nancial results, reputation and 
brand value. Such development activities could further be challenged by 
scarcity of skilled resources in a competitive labour market. In addition, 
while AI could provide for better, cost
-
effective and convenient customer 
experiences, we must carefully assess the challenges associated with 
the use of such technology by us as well as by our competitors.

Our˝˙ nancial 
resources 
Our operations, service performance, reputation and business 
continuity depend on how well we protect our physical and 
non-physical assets, including from information security threats 
Our operations, service performance, reputation and business continuity 
depend on how well we protect our physical and non-physical 
assets, including networks, IT systems, of˙ces, corporate stores and 
sensitive information, from events such as information security attacks, 
unauthorized access or entry, ˙re, natural disasters, power loss, building 
cooling loss, acts of war or terrorism, sabotage, vandalism, actions of 
neighbours and other events. The protection and effective organization 
of our systems, applications and information repositories are central to 
the secure and continuous operation of our networks and business, as 
electronic and physical records of proprietary business and personal 
data, such as con˙dential customer and employee information, are all 
sensitive from a market and privacy perspective. 
Information security breaches can result from deliberate or unintended 
actions by a growing number of sophisticated actors, including hackers, 
organized criminals, state-sponsored organizations and other parties. 
Information security attacks have grown in complexity, magnitude and 
frequency in recent years and the potential for damage is increasing. 
Information security attacks may be perpetrated using a complex 
array of ever evolving and changing means including, without limitation, 
the use of stolen credentials, social engineering, computer viruses 
and malicious software, phishing and other attacks on network and 
information systems. Information security attacks aim to achieve 
various malicious objectives including unauthorized access to, ransom/ 
encryption of, and theft of, con˙dential, proprietary, sensitive or personal 
information, as˝well as extortion and business disruptions. 
We are also exposed to information security threats as a result of actions 
that may be taken by our customers, suppliers, outsourcers, business 
partners, employees or independent third parties, whether malicious 
or not , including as a result of the use of social media, cloud-based 
solutions and IT consumerization. Our use of third-party suppliers and 
outsourcers and reliance on business partners, which may similarly 
be subject to information security threats, also expose us to risks as 
we have less immediate oversight over their IT domains. Furthermore, 
the introduction of G, cloud computing and the proliferation of data 
services, including mobile TV, mobile commerce, mobile banking 
and IoT applications, as well as increased digitization and the use 
or misuse of emerging technologies such as AI, robotics and smart 
contracts leveraging blockchain for digital certi˙cation, have signi˙cantly 
increased the threat surface of our networks and systems, resulting in 
higher complexity that needs to be carefully monitored and managed to 
minimize security threats. Failure to implement an information security 
program that ef˙ciently considers relationships and interactions with 
business partners, suppliers, customers, employees and other third 
parties across all methods of communication, including social media and 
cloud-based solutions, could adversely affect our ability to successfully 
defend against information security attacks. 
Changes in behaviour further to the COVID-ˆˇ pandemic as well as recent 
geopolitical events have further increased our exposure to information 
security threats. Remote work arrangements of our employees and those 
of our suppliers have increased remote connectivity to our systems 
and the potential use of unauthorized communications technologies. 
In addition, we have seen an increase in global criminal activity, which 
further pressures our security environment . 
If information security threats were to become successful attacks 
resulting in information security breaches, they could harm our brand, 
reputation and competitiveness, decrease customer and investor 
con˙dence and adversely affect our business, ˙nancial results, stock 
price and long-term shareholder value, given that they could lead to: 
Ł 
Network operating failures and business disruptions, which could
negatively impact our ability to sell products and services to our
customers and adversely affect their ability to maintain normal
business operations and deliver critical services, and/or the ability
of third-party suppliers to deliver critical services to us 
Ł 
Unauthorized access to, and use of, proprietary or sensitive information, 
which could result in lost revenue, diminished competitive advantages, 
challenges in retaining or attracting customers after an incident and 
loss of future business opportunities 
Ł 
Theft, loss, unauthorized disclosure, destruction, encryption or
corruption of data and con˙dential information, including personal
information about our customers or employees, that could result
in˝ ˙nancial loss, exposure to claims for damages by customers,
employees and others, extortion threats due to ransomware and
dif˙culty in accessing materials to defend legal actions 
Ł 
Physical damage to network assets impacting service continuity 
Ł 
Fines and sanctions for failure to meet legislative requirements or

from credit card providers for failing to comply with payment card

industry data security standards for protection of cardholder data
Ł 
Increased fraud as criminals leverage stolen information against our 
customers, our employees or our company 
Ł 
Remediation costs such as liability for stolen information, equipment 
repair and service recovery, and incentives to customers or business 
partners in an effort to maintain relationships after an incident 
Ł 
Increased information security protection costs, including the costs of 
deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training 
and monitoring employees, and engaging third-party security experts 
and auditors 
Ł 
Changes in the terms, conditions and pricing of customer, supplier

and ˙nancial contracts and agreements that we may have

In light of the evolving nature and sophistication of information security 
threats, our information security policies, procedures and controls must 
continuously adapt and evolve in order to seek to mitigate risk and, 
consequently, require constant monitoring to ensure effectiveness. 
However, given the complexity and scale of our business, network 
infrastructure, technology and IT supporting systems, there can be no 
assurance that the security policies, procedures and controls that we 
implement will be effective against all information security attacks. In 
addition, there can be no assurance that any insurance we may have 
will cover all or part of the costs, damages, liabilities or losses that 
could result from the occurrence of any information security breach. 
Failure to implement an effective data governance framework could 
harm our brand and reputation, expose us to regulatory pressure 
and penalties, constrain our competitive opportunities, and adversely 
affect our business and ˜nancial results 
To achieve our purpose of advancing how Canadians connect with 
each other and the world, we must preserve the social licence from our 
customers and all Canadians to collect and use data in our operations. A 
strong and consistent ly applied approach to data governance is critical 
to maintaining that social licence, requiring us to focus on respecting 
the privacy of our customers™ data and protecting such data against 
information security threats. As our operations involve receiving, 
processing and storing such proprietary business and personal data, 
effective policies, procedures and controls must be implemented to 
protect information systems and underlying data in accordance with 
applicable privacy legislation. Failure to meet customer and employee 
expectations regarding the appropriate use and protection of their data 
could have negative reputational, business and ˙nancial consequences 
for the company. 
There has also been increased regulatory scrutiny over the use, collection, 
and disclosure of personal information in Canada. We are subject to 
various privacy legislation, such as Canada™s anti-spam legislation (CASL) 
and the 
Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act
, 
as well as foreign privacy legislation via the mandatory ow-through 
of privacy-related obligations by our customers, including those of the 
General Data Protection Regulation
 (EU). Global and domestic regulation 
around privacy and data practices are evolving rapidly and new or 

amended privacy legislation has been proposed or adopted federally 

and in a number of Canadian provincial jurisdictions with signi˙cant 
obligations, limitations on the use of personal information, penalties 
and short implementation horizons. Our data governance framework 
must not only meet applicable privacy requirements, but also be able to 
evolve for continuous improvement. Effective data governance is also a 
component of good ESG practices, which are considered an increasingly 
important measure of corporate performance and value creation. 
Failure to implement an effective data governance framework 
encompassing the protection and appropriate use of data across its 
life cycle, and incorporating data governance as a core consideration 
in our business initiatives and technology decisions, could harm our 
brand, reputation and competitiveness, decrease customer and investor 
con˙dence and adversely affect our business and ˙nancial results. It 

could give rise to litigation, investigations, ˙nes and liability for failure 
to comply with increasingly stringent privacy legislation, as well as 
increased audit and regulatory scrutiny that could divert resources 
from business operations.

Attracting, developing and retaining a diverse and talented team 
capable of furthering our strategic imperatives and high-tech 
transformation is essential to our success 
Our business depends on the efforts, engagement and expertise of 
our management and non-management employees and contractors, 
who must be able to operate ef˙ciently and safely based on their 
responsibilities and the environment in which they are functioning. 
Demand for highly skilled team members has intensi˙ed, as retiring 
workers, varying levels of immigration, and an increase in remote-work 
arrangements allowing more global competition have created an 
even more competitive marketplace. This emphasizes the importance 

of developing and maintaining a comprehensive and inclusive human 
resources strategy and employee value proposition to adequately 
compete for talent and to identify and secure high-performing 
candidates for a broad range of job functions, roles and responsibilities. 
In addition, an appropriately skilled and diversi˙ed pool of talent (as a 
result of hiring, insourcing and reskilling) is essential to support evolving 
business priorities in the context of an ongoing business transformation 
impacting job nature and skill sets. Our objective to transform from a 
telco to a techco requires a cultural change and a capacity to evolve, 
and impacts our recruitment strategy and deployment of resources. 
Failure to attract and appropriately train, motivate, remunerate or 
deployemployees oninitiatives thatfurther ourstrategic imperatives 
and high-tech transformation, or to ef˙ciently replace departing 
employees, could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and 
retain talent and drive performance across the organization. Shortages 
of skilled labour could negatively affect our ability to implement our 
strategic priorities, as well as sell our products and services and more 
generally serve our customers. 
Establishing a culture that drives inclusivity, employee engagement , 
development and progression is essential to attract and retain talent. 
In addition, employees are typically more engaged at work when their 
value system aligns with their employer™s corporate values. We seek 
to foster an inclusive, equitable and accessible workplace where team 
members are valued, respected and supported, reecting the diversity 
of the communities we serve and our desire to provide team members 
with the opportunity to reach their full potential. We further endeavour 
to establish programs and provide resources to support team members 
on a wide range of topics, including mental health services and support. 
However, failure to establish robust programs to further these aspirations 
could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain team members. 
Failure to suf˙ciently address evolving employee expectations related 
to our culture and value proposition could also adversely affect our 
ability to attract and retain team members.

As we emerged from the COVID-ˆˇ˝pandemic, we introduced our Bell 
Workways program to help team members and leaders manage work, 
family and other commitments by offering a new approach for our 
workplace that allows exibility for team members on how and where 
they work, depending on their new designated role-based work pro˙les 
(remote, mobile or full-time of˙ce). However, exible work models 
require a cultural shift that may impact business activities. Failure to 
establish an optimal post-pandemic work arrangement conducive 
to˝corporate performance and employee preference, and develop 
new leadership skills necessary in the context of a new hybrid model, 
could impair our ability to engage, motivate and retain employees, 
impact productivity, increase the number of employees on disability 
leave for mental health reasons, and introduce additional operational 
risks or exacerbate our exposure to existing ones, which could impair 
our ability to manage our business. 
Other examples of people-related risks include the following: 
Ł 
The increasing technical and operational complexity of our businesses 
and the high demand in the market for skilled resources in strategic 
areas create a challenging environment for hiring, retaining and
developing such skilled resources 
Ł 
Failure to establish a complete and effective succession plan, including 
preparation of internal talent and identi˙cation of potential external 
candidates, where relevant, for senior executive and other key roles, 
could impair our business until quali˙ed replacements are found 
Ł 
Ensuring the health and safety of our workforce operating in different 
environments, including manholes, telephone poles, cell towers,
vehicles, foreign news bureaus and war zones, and/or in times of
pandemic, requires focus, effective processes and exibility to avoid 
injury, illness, service interruption, ˙nes and reputational impact 
Ł 
Potential deterioration in employee morale and engagement resulting 
from staff reductions, cost reductions or reorganizations could
adversely affect our business and ˙nancial results 
Challenges related to collective agreements could adversely affect 
our business 
Approximately ˜% of BCE employees were represented by unions
and were covered by collective agreements at December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˛.
The positive engagement of members of our team represented by
unions is contingent on negotiating collective agreements that deliver 
competitive labour conditions and uninterrupted service, both of which 
are critical to achieving our business objectives. 
We cannot predict the outcome of collective agreement negotiations. 
Renewal of collective agreements could result in higher labour costs
and be challenging in the context of a declining workload due to
transformation, a maturing footprint, improved ef˙ciencies and adverse 
government or regulatory decisions. If during the bargaining process 
there were to be project delays and work disruptions, including work 
stoppages or work slowdowns, this could adversely affect service to 
our customers and, in turn, our customer relationships and ˙nancial
performance. 
Operational performance 
Our 
networks 
Our˝products 
and services 
Our˝˙ nancial 
resources 
Our networks and IT systems are the foundation of high-quality 
consistentservices, whicharecriticalto meeting service expectations 
Our ability to provide high-quality and consistent wireless, wireline 
and media services to customers in a complex and changing operating 
environment is crucial for sustained success. It is therefore essential 
that we continuously re˙ne our operating model in order to accelerate 
our transition from a telco to a techco, and meet customer expectations 
of product and service experience at a desired cost structure. 
Network capacity demands for content offerings and other bandwidth-
intensive applications on our wireline and wireless networks have been 
growing at unprecedented rates. Unexpected capacity pressures on 
our networks may negatively affect our network performance and our 
ability to provide services. Evolving customer behaviour and their use of 
our networks, products and services have created increased capacity 
pressure on certain areas of our wireless, wireline and broadcast 
media networks, and there can be no certainty that our networks will 
continue to sustain such increased usage. In addition, we may need 
to incur signi˙cant capital expenditures in order to provide additional 
capacity and reduce network congestion. Network performance and/or 
reliability may vary depending on the location and the recent trend for 
families to move from urban centres to less urbanized areas increases 
the need to develop and/or enhance our networks in areas that were 
not previously served or that were underserved. 
Customers andotherstakeholders expect that wedeliver reliable service 
performance, enabled by our networks and other infrastructure, as well 
as the networks and other infrastructure of third-party providers on 
which we rely. Issues relating to network availability, speed, consistency 
and traf˙c management on our more current as well as our legacy 
networks could adversely affect our customers, including by preventing 
the provisioning of critical services, and could have an adverse impact 
on our business, reputation and ˙nancial performance. Furthermore, 
we may need to manage the possibility of instability in the context 
of our transformation initiatives, including as we transition towards 
converged wireline and wireless networks and newer technologies, 
including software-de˙ned networks leveraging open source software 
and cloud services. Network failures and slowdowns, whether caused 
by internal or external forces, human-caused error or threat, or external 
events, could adversely affect our brand and reputation, subscriber 
acquisition and retention as well as our ˙nancial results. While we invest 
in the resiliency of our networks and other infrastructure and establish 
response strategies and business continuity protocols to seek to maintain 
service consistency, there is no assurance that such investments and 
protocols will be suf˙cient to prevent network failure or the failure 
of other infrastructure, or a disruption in the delivery of our services. 
In addition, we current ly use a very large number of interconnected 
internal and third-party operational and business support systems for 
provisioning, networking, distribution,broadcast management, ordering, 
billing and accounting, which may hinder our operational ef˙ciency. 
If˝we fail to implement, maintain or manage highly effective IT systems 
supported by an effective governance and operating framework, and 
implement transformation initiatives to streamline and integrate our 
processes and systems, this may lead to inconsistent performance 
and dissatis˙ed customers, which over time could result in higher 
churn. It may also limit our cross-sell capabilities across our portfolio 

of products and services.

Further examples of risks to operational performance that could impact 
our reputation, business operations and ˙nancial performance include 
the following: 
Ł 
The current global economic environment as well as geopolitical events 
may bring about further incremental costs, delays or unavailability of 
equipment, materials and resources, which may impact our ability to 
maintain or upgrade our networks in order to accommodate increased 
network usage and to provide the desired levels of customer service 
Ł 
Failure to maintain required service delivery amid operational
challenges (including those related to targeted cost savings initiatives, 
exible work models and the availability of employees with the required 
skill set) and a transformation of our infrastructure and technology
could adversely affect our brand, reputation and ˙nancial results 
Ł 
We may lose sales should we fail to maximize channel ef˙ciencies,

which could adversely affect our ˙nancial results 
Ł 
Corporate restructurings, system replacements and upgrades, process 
redesigns, staff reductions and the integration of business acquisitions 
may not deliver the bene˙ts contemplated, or be completed when

expected, and could adversely impact our ongoing operations 
Ł 
Failure to streamline our signi˙cant IT legacy system portfolio and

proactively improve operating performance could adversely affect

our business and ˙nancial results 
Ł 
We may experience more service interruptions or outages due to
legacy infrastructure. In some cases, vendor support is no longer
available or legacy vendor operations have ceased. 
Ł 
There may be a lack of replacement parts and competent and
cost-effective resources to perform the life cycle management and 
upgrades necessary to maintain the operational status of legacy
networks and IT systems 
Ł 
Climate change increases the probability, frequency, intensity and
length of severe weather-related events such as ice, snow and wind 
storms, wild˙res, ooding, extended heat waves, hurricanes, tornadoes 
and tsunamis, all of which could impact network availability and
performance and drive more repairs of network equipment 
Our operations and business continuity depend on how well we
protect, test, maintain, replace and upgrade our networks, IT systems, 
equipment and other facilities 
Our operations, service performance, reputation, business continuity 
and strategy depend on how well we and our contracted product and 
service providers, as well as other telecommunications carriers on
which we rely to provide services, protect our or their networks and
IT systems, as well as other infrastructure and facilities, from events
such as information security attacks, unauthorized access or entry,
˙re, natural disasters, power loss, building cooling loss, acts of war or 
terrorism, sabotage, vandalism, actions of neighbours and other events. 
Climate change, especially in areas of greater environmental sensitivity, 
could heighten the occurrence of certain of the above-mentioned risks. 
We must also manage business continuity issues caused by internal 
sources, including human error, human-caused threats and inef˙ciencies. 
Establishing response strategies and business continuity protocols 
to maintain service consistency if any disruptive event materializes 
is critical to the achievement of effective customer service. Any of 
the above-mentioned events, as well as the failure by us, or by other 
telecommunications carriers on which we rely to provide services, 
to adequately complete planned and suf˙cient testing, maintenance, 
replacement or upgrade of our or their networks, equipment and 
other facilities, which is, among other factors, dependent on our or 
their ability to purchase equipment and services from third-party 
suppliers, could disrupt our operations (including through disruptions 
such as network and other infrastructure failures, billing errors or 
delays in customer service), require signi˙cant resources and result 
in signi˙cant remediation costs, which in turn could have an adverse 
effect on our business and ˙nancial performance, or impair our ability 
to keep existing subscribers or attract new ones. 
In addition, the current global economic environment as well as 
geopolitical events may bring about further incremental costs, delays 
or unavailability of equipment , materials and resources, which could 
impact our operations and business continuity strategies. 
Satellites used to provide our satellite TV ser vices are subject to 
signi˜cant operational risks 
that could have an adverse effect on 
our business and ˜nancial performance 
Pursuant to a set of commercial arrangements between ExpressVu 
and Telesat Canada (Telesat), we currently have satellites under 
contract with Telesat. Telesat operates or directs the operation of these 
satellites, which utilize highly complex technology and operate in the 
harsh environment of space and are therefore subject to signi˙cant 
operational risks while in orbit . These risks include in-orbit equipment 
failures, malfunctions and other problems, commonly referred to as 
anomalies, that could reduce the commercial usefulness of a satellite 
used to provide our satellite TV services. Acts of war or terrorism, 
magnetic, electrostatic or solar storms, or space debris or meteoroids 
could also damage such satellites. Any loss, failure, manufacturing defect , 
damage or destruction of these satellites, of our terrestrial broadcasting 
infrastructure or of Telesat™s tracking, telemetry and control facilities 
to operate the satellites could have an adverse effect on our business 
and ˙nancial performance and could result in customers terminating 
their subscriptions to our satellite TV service.

If we are unable to raise the capital we need or generate suf˜cient 
cash ows from operating activities, we may need to limit our capital 
expenditures or our investments in new businesses, or try to raise 

capital by disposing of assets 
Our ability to meet our cash requirements, fund capital expenditures

sources of capital and on our ability to generate cash ows from 
operating activities, which is subject to various risks, including those 

described in this MD& A. 
Our ability to raise ˙nancing depends on our ability to access the

general or fewer banks as a result of reduced activity or consolidation, 
could reduce capital available or increase the cost of such capital. In 
addition, an increased level of debt borrowings could result in lower 
credit ratings, increased borrowing costs and a reduction in the amount 
of funding available to us, including through equity offerings. Business 
acquisitions and our acquisition of wireless spectrum licences could 

also adversely affect our outlook and credit ratings and have similar 

adverse consequences. There is no assurance that we will maintain 
our credit ratings and a ratings downgrade could result in adverse 

consequences for our funding cost and capacity, and our ability to 
access the capital markets, money market and/or the bank credit market. 
In addition, participants in the public capital and bank credit markets 
have internal policies limiting their ability to invest in, or extend credit 
to, any single entity or entity group or a particular industry. Finally, with 
increasing emphasis by the capital markets on ESG performance and 
reporting, there is a potential for the cost and availability of funding 
to be increasingly tied to the quality of our ESG practices and related 
disclosed metrics. 
Our bank credit facilities, including credit facilities supporting our 
commercial paper program, are provided by various ˙nancial institutions. 
While it is our intention to renew certain of such credit facilities from time 
to time, there are no assurances that these facilities will be renewed 
on favourable terms or in similar amounts. 
Global ˙nancial markets have experienced, and could again experience, 
signi˙cant volatility and weakness as a result of market disruptions, 
including relating to the economy and geopolitical events. The current 
global economic environment could continue to negatively impact equity 
and debt capital markets, cause interest rate and currency volatility 

and movements, and adversely affect our ability to raise ˙nancing in 
the public capital, bank credit and/or commercial paper markets as 
well as the cost thereof. Additionally, the negative impact of the global 
economic environment and potential recession, elevated ination and 
high interest rates on our customers™ ˙nancial condition could adversely 
affect our ability to recover payment of receivables from customers and 
lead to further increases in bad debts, thereby negatively affecting our 
revenues and cash ows, as well as our position under our securitized 
receivables program. 
Differences between BCE™s actual or anticipated ˙nancial results and 
the published expectations of ˙nancial analysts, as well as events 
affecting our business or operating environment , may contribute to 
volatility in the market price of BCE™s securities. A major decline in the 
capital markets in general, or an adjustment in the market price or 
trading volumes of BCE™s securities, may negatively affect our ability 

to raise debt or equity capital, retain senior executives and other key 
employees, make strategic acquisitions or enter into joint ventures. 
If we cannot access the capital we need or generate cash ows to 
implement our business plan or meet our ˙nancial obligations on 
acceptable terms, we may have to limit our ongoing capital expenditures 
and our investment in new businesses or try to raise additional capital 
by selling or otherwise disposing of assets. Any of these could have 

an adverse effect on our cash ows from operating activities and on 
our growth prospects. 
We cannot guarantee that dividends will be increased or declared 
Increases in the BCE common share dividend and the declaration 
of dividends on any of BCE™s outstanding shares are subject to the 
discretion of the BCE Board and, consequently, there can be no 
guarantee that the dividend on common shares will be increased 
or that dividends will be declared. Dividend increases and the 
declaration of dividends by the BCE Board are ultimately dependent 

on BCE™s operations and ˙nancial results which are, in turn, subject to 
various assumptions and risks, including those set out in this MD& A. 
The failure to reduce costs, unexpected increases in costs and the 
failure to optimize capital spending, could adversely affect our 
ability to achieve our strategic imperatives and ˜nancial guidance 
Our objective to lower our cost structure continues to be aggressive 
with a company-wide focus on cost transformation and reduction, 
but there is no assurance that we will be successful in reducing costs. 
Examples of risks to our ability to reduce costs or limit potential cost 
increases include the following: 
Ł 
Ination could continue to result in higher input costs for equipment, 
products and services, and create increased pressure for wage
increases 
Ł 
Increased costs related to geopolitical events, in particular as 
they
impact our supply chain, could continue for an undetermined period 

of time 
Ł 
Increasing or prevailing high interest rates could continue to negatively 
impact our cost of ˙nancing 
Ł 
Our cost reduction objectives require aggressive negotiations with

oursuppliers and there can be no assurance that such negotiations 
will be successful or that replacement products or services provided 
will not lead to operational issues 
Ł 
As suppliers continue to shorten software life cycles, the cost of seeking 
to maintain adequate information security increases 
Ł 
Achieving timely cost reductions while moving to an IP-based network 
is dependent on disciplined network decommissioning, which can
be delayed by customer contractual commitments, regulatory
considerations and other unforeseen obstacles 
Ł 
Failure to contain growing operational costs related to network sites, 
network performance and resiliency, footprint expansion, spectrum 
licences, insurance and content and equipment acquisition could have 
a negative effect on our ˙nancial performance 
Ł 
In addition to the potential impact from the global economic
environment and geopolitical events, uctuations in energy prices
are further partly inuenced by government policies to address climate 
change such as carbon pricing which, combined with growing data 
demand that increases our energy requirements, could increase our 
energy costs beyond our current expectations 
Ł 
Failure to successfully deliver on our contractual commitments, whether 
due to security events, operational challenges or other reasons, may 
result in ˙nancial penalties and loss of revenues 
In addition, as part of our business operations and transformation
initiatives, it is essential that we optimize capital spending and ensure 
appropriate trade-offs in our capital allocation. However, should we
fail to adequately assess investment priorities and optimal trade-offs, 
our business and ˙nancial results could be negatively affected.

Financial risk management
 of this MD& A and in Note˝˜ˇ to BCE™s˝˜˚˜˛ 
consolidated ˙nancial statements. 
Our failure to identify and manage our exposure to changes in interest 
rates, foreign exchange rates, BCE™s share price and other market 
conditions could lead to missed opportunities, increased costs, reduced 
pro˙t margins, cash ow shortages, inability to complete planned 
capital expenditures, reputational damage, equity and debt securities 
devaluations, and challenges in raising capital on market-competitive 
terms. 
The failure to evolve practices to effectively monitor and control 
fraudulent activities could result in ˜nancial loss and brand 
degradation 
As a public company with a range of desirable and valuable products 
and services and a large number of employees, BCE requires a 
disciplined program covering governance, exposure identi˙cation 
and assessment, prevention, detection and reporting that considers 
corruption, misappropriation of assets and intentional manipulation of 
˙nancial statements by employees and/or external parties. The current 
global economic environment could further lead to increased fraud 
activities, which could result in ˙nancial loss and brand degradation.

Copyright theft and other forms of unauthorized use that undermine 
the exclusivity of Bell Media™s content offerings, which could divert
users to unlicensed or otherwise illegitimate platforms, thus impacting 
our ability to derive distribution and advertising revenues 
Ł 
Unauthorized individuals taking over someone else™s online account 
without the account owner‚s permission to gain access to wireless
productsand 
goods via various means (social engineering, phishing, 
smishing, etc.) 
Ł 
Subscription fraud where fraudsters use their own, a stolen or a
synthetic identity to obtain mobile devices and services with no
intention to pay 
Ł 
Network usage fraud such as call/sell operations using our wireline 
or wireless networks or incidents related to network components
such as copper theft 
Ł 
Ongoing efforts to steal the services of TV distributors, including Bell 
Canada and ExpressVu, through compromise or circumvention of
signal security systems, causing revenue loss 
Income and commodity tax amounts may materially differ from the 
expected amounts 
Our complex business operations are subject to various tax laws. The 
adoption of new tax laws, or regulations or rules thereunder, or changes 
thereto or in the interpretation thereof, could result in higher tax rates, 
newtaxes or otheradversetaximplications.Inaddition,whilewebelieve 
that we have adequately provided for all income and commodity taxes 
based on all of the information that is current ly available, the calculation 
of income taxes and the applicability of commodity taxes in many cases 
require signi˙cant judgment in interpreting tax rules and regulations. Our 
tax ˙lings are subject to government audits that could result in material 
changes to the amount of current and deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities and other liabilities and could, in certain circumstances, result 
in an assessment of interest and penalties. 
A number of factors could impact our ˜nancial statements and 
estimates 
We base our estimates on a number of factors, including but not 
limited to historical experience, current events, and actions that the 
company may undertake in the future, as well as other assumptions 
that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. A change in 

these assumptions may have an impact on our ˙nancial statements 
including but not limited to impairment testing, fair value determination, 
expected credit losses and discount rates used for the present value of 
cash ows. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject 
to measurement uncertainty and actual results could differ. 
The economic environment, pension rules or ineffective governance 
could have an adverse effect on our pension obligations, and we 
may be required to increase contributions to our post-employment 
bene˜t plans 
With a large pension plan membership and DB pension plans that 
are subject to the pressures of the global economic environment 
and changing regulatory and reporting requirements, our pension 
obligations are exposed to potential volatility. Failure to recognize and 
manage economic exposure and pension rule changes, or to ensure 
that effective governance is in place for the management and funding 
of pension plan assets and obligations, could have an adverse impact 

on our liquidity and ˙nancial performance. 
The funding requirements of our post-employment bene˙t plans, based 
on valuations of plan assets and obligations, depend on a number of 
factors, including actual returns on post-employment bene˙t plan 
assets, long-term interest rates, ination, plan demographics including 
longevity, and applicable regulations and actuarial standards. Changes 
in these factors, including changes caused by the current global 
economic environment and recent geopolitical events, could cause 
future contributions to signi˙cant ly differ from our current estimates, 
require us to increase contributions to our post-employment bene˙t 
plans in the future and, therefore, have a negative effect on our liquidity 
and ˙nancial performance. 
There is no assurance that the assets of our post-employment bene˙t 
plans will earn their assumed rate of return. A substantial portion of our 
post-employment bene˙t plans™ assets is invested in public and private 
equity and debt securities. Asa result, theability of our post-employment 
bene˙t plans™ assets to earn the rate of return that we have assumed 
depends signi˙cant ly on the performance of capital markets. Market 
conditions also impact the discount rate used to calculate our pension 
plan solvency obligations and could therefore also signi˙cantly affect 
our cash funding requirements.

Vendor management/supply chain 
Our

and˝relationships 
Our˝products 
and services 
Our 
environment 
Our˝˙ nancial 
resources 
We depend on third-party suppliers, outsourcers and consultants, 
some of which are critical, to provide an uninterrupted supply of 
the products and ser vices we need, as well as comply with various 
obligations 
We depend on key third-party suppliers and outsourcers, over which we 
have no operational or ˙nancial control, for products and services, some 
of which are critical to our operations. If there are gaps in our vendor 
selection, governance or oversight processes established to seek to 
ensure full risk transparency at point of purchase and throughout the 
relationship, including any contract renegotiations, there is the potential 
for a breakdown in supply, which could impact our ability to make sales, 
service customers and achieve our business and ˙nancial objectives. 
In addition, any such gaps could result in suboptimal management of 
our vendor base, increased costs and missed opportunities. Ongoing 
relationships must further be adequately managed in order to address 
existing and new operational and compliance requirements. Some 
of our third-party suppliers and outsourcers are located in foreign 
countries, which increases the potential for a breakdown in supply 
due to the risks of operating in foreign jurisdictions with different 
laws, geopolitical environments and cultures, as well as the potential 
for localized natural disasters. Concerns related to geopolitical events 
could put pressure on our supply chain and require increased focus 
on supply chain diversi˙cation to support continuity. 
We may have to select different third-party suppliers for equipment or 
other products and services, or different outsourcers, in order to meet 
evolving internal company policies and guidelines as well as regulatory 
requirements. Should we decide, or be required by a governmental 

authority or otherwise, to terminate our relationship with an existing 
supplier or outsourcer, this would decrease the number of available 
suppliers or outsourcers and could result in signi˙cant increased costs, 
as well as transitional, support , service, quality or continuity issues; 
delay our ability to deploy new network and other technologies and 

offer new products and services; and adversely affect our business 
and ˙nancial results. 
The use of third-party suppliers and the outsourcing of services generally 
involve transfer of risks, and we must take appropriate steps to ensure 
that our suppliers™ and outsourcers™ approach to risk management 
is aligned with our own standards in order to maintain continuity of 
supply and brand strength. Increased focus on supplier risks in areas 
of security, data governance, responsible procurement and broader 
ESG factors requires increased attention given that supplier actions 
or omissions could have signi˙cant impacts on our business, ˙nancial 
results, brand and reputation. Furthermore, cloud-based supplier 
models have continued to evolve and grow and, while they offer many 
potential bene˙ts, cloud-based services can also change the level or 
types of risks. Accordingly, our procurement and vendor management 
practices must also continue to evolve to fully take into account the 

potential risks of cloud-based services. 
In addition, certain company initiatives rely heavily on professional 
consulting services provided by third parties, and a failure of such 
third-party services may not be reasonably evident until their work is 
delivered or delayed. Dif˙culties in implementing remedial strategies 
in respect of professional consulting services provided by third parties 
that are not performed in a proper or timely fashion could result in 
an adverse effect on our ability to comply with various obligations, 
including applicable legal and accounting requirements. 
Other examples of risks associated with third-party suppliers and 
outsourcers include the following: 
Ł 
We rely upon the successful implementation and execution of business 
continuity plans by our product and service suppliers. To the extent
that such plans do not successfully mitigate the impacts of the
current global economic environment , geopolitical events or other
events, and our suppliers or vendors experience operational failures 
or inventory constraints, such failures or constraints could result in, 
or amplify existing, supply chain disruptions that could adversely
affect our business. Incremental costs, delays or unavailability of
equipment , materials, products or services, as well as unavailability 
of our suppliers™ or contractors™ employees due to strikes, workforce 
reduction initiatives or other factors, could impact sales and execution 
of our strategic imperatives and adversely affect our business and

˙nancial results. 
Ł 
The current global economic environment and recent geopolitical
events have given rise to inationary pressures and sharp increases 
in prices, which could put increased pressure on purchasing costs
Ł 
The insolvency of one or more of our suppliers could cause a
breakdown in supply and have an adverse effect on our operations, 

including our ability to make sales or service customers, as well as

on our ˙nancial results 
Ł 
Demand for products and services available from only a limited number 
of suppliers, some of which dominate their global market, may lead to 
decreased availability, increased costs or delays in the delivery of such 
products and services, since suppliers may choose to favour global 

competitors that are larger than we are and, accordingly, purchase 
a larger volume of products and services. In addition, production
issues or geopolitical events affecting any such suppliers, or other
suppliers, could result in decreased quantities or a total lack of supply 
of products or services. Any of these events could adversely impact 

our ability to meet customer commitments and demand. 
Ł 
A suboptimal outsourcing model could result in the loss of key corporate 
knowledge, reduced ef˙ciency and effectiveness, and impede agile

delivery of new products or technology 
Ł 
Cloud-based solutions may increase the risk of security and data
leakage exposure if security control protocols and con˙gurations
implemented by our cloud-based partners or suppliers, or by us
where we retain responsibility for such protocols, are inadequate
Ł 
If existing suppliers do not have appropriate alternative cloud-based 
products or services, our ability to complete desired migrations to the 
cloud could be limited or delayed 
Ł 
Failure to maintain strong discipline around vendor administration
(especially around initial account setup) may mask potential ˙nancial 
or operational risks and complicate future problem resolutions

If products and services important to our operations have
manufacturing defects or do not comply with applicable government 
regulations and standards (including product safety practices), our
ability to sell products and provide services on a timely basis may be 
negatively impacted. We work with our suppliers to seek to identify
serious product defects (including safety incidents) and develop
appropriate remedial strategies, which may include a recall of products. 
To the extent that a supplier does not actively participate in, and/or
bear primary ˙nancial responsibility for, a recall of its products, our 

ability to perform such recall programs at a reasonable cost and/or 

in a timely fashion may be negatively impacted. Any of the events
referred to above could have an adverse effect on our business,
reputation and ˙nancial results. 
Ł 
Products (including software) and services supplied to us may contain 
security issues including, but not limited to, latent security issues that 
would not be apparent upon an inspection. Should we or a supplier

fail to correct a security issue in a timely fashion, there could be an

adverse effect on our business, reputation and ˙nancial results. 
Ł 
We rely on other telecommunications carriers from time to time to
deliver services. Should these carriers fail to roll out new networks or 
fail to upgrade existing networks, or should their networks be affected 
by operational failures or service interruptions, such issues could
adversely affect our ability to provide services using such carriers™

networks and could, consequently, have an adverse effect on our

business, reputation and ˙nancial results.

BCE depends on call centre and technical support services provided 
by a number of external suppliers and outsourcers, some of which are 
located in foreign countries. These vendors have access to customer 
and internal BCE information necessary for the support services that

Our ability to maintain positive customer relationships is signi˜cantly 
inuenced by our reputation 
Many customers™ choice to purchase our products and services is 
direct ly related to their perception of our company. Accordingly, our 
ability to maintain positive customer relationships and acquire or retain 
customers is signi˙cant ly inuenced by our reputation. The company 
faces many sources of reputational risks, as discussed in this MD& A. 
Should our perceived or actual out look, plans, priorities or actions, or 
those of our employees or suppliers, fail to align with stakeholders™ 
expectations, our reputation could be impacted, which could have an 
adverse effect on our brand, our ability to retain or attract customers, 

and more generally on our business, ˙nancial condition, liquidity and 
˙nancial results. 
There is no assurance that we will succeed in meaningfully integrating 
ESG considerations into our business strategy and operations to 
generate a positive outcome for stakeholders 
While we seek to understand the evolving ESG environment and 
identify topics and activities that may expose us to ESG risks, there 

is no assurance that we will succeed in meaningfully integrating ESG 
considerations into our business strategy and operations to generate 
positive outcomes for stakeholders. Good ESG practices are an important 
measure of corporate performance and value creation. As such, we 
are increasingly under scrutiny to address ESG matters of importance 
to our stakeholders. A wide range of ESG topics have progressively 
become important elements of corporate culture and seeking to embrace 
them reinforces our value proposition to drive employee attraction and 
retention. Customers now factor broader considerations into purchase 
decisions and look for alignment of personal values with corporate 
behaviour. Investors increasingly link investment decisions to the quality 
of ESG practices and related disclosed metrics. Moreover, we have 
directly linked some pricing elements in certain ˙nancing agreements 
to our performance on key ESG targets. Legal and regulatory pressures 
have further intensi˙ed in the ESG sphere, including, without limitation, 
in the areas of privacy, accessibility, data governance, climate change 
and diversity. Accordingly, failure to integrate ESG considerations 
into our governance activities and effectively manage ESG risks and 
opportunities could harm our brand and reputation, and could lead to 
negative business, ˙nancial, legal and regulatory consequences for 
the company. Perceived misalignment of our actions with stakeholder 
expectations could also harm our brand and reputation and lead to 
further ˙nancial and other consequences. Finally, enhanced ESG-related 
disclosures could increase the company™s exposure to claims for 
misrepresentation in the primary or secondary market . 
Failure to take appropriate actions to adapt to current and emerging 
environmental impacts, including climate change, could have an 
adverse effect on our business 
We face risks related to environmental events, including climate-related 
events, which could impact our operations, service performance, 
reputation and business continuity, cost of insurance, and more generally 
have an adverse effect on our business, ˙nancial performance and 
reputation. In particular, climate change poses potential risks to our 
business, our employees, our customers, our suppliers and outsourcers, 
and the communities we operate in. Inadequate management of 
environmental issues associated with our company and our business, 
as well as our suppliers and other stakeholders, could also adversely 

affect our business, ˙nancial condition, liquidity, ˙nancial results and 

reputation given the implications for the company as well as various 
stakeholders.

In alignment with the recommendations of the TCFD, we categorize 
climate-related risks into physical and transition risks: 
Ł 
Physical risks are associated with the physical impacts from a changing 
climate and can either be event-driven (acute) or longer-term (chronic) 
shifts in climate patterns. Global scienti˙c evidence suggests that
climate change will increase both the frequency and severity of
extreme weather events. This will include such events as ooding, ice 
storms and wild˙res, among others. These could have a destructive 

impact on our communications network infrastructure and in turn
affect our ability to deliver services that are critical to our customers 
and society. A service disruption due to extreme weather events
could lead to ˙nancial impacts including an increase in operating
costs from maintenance and repairs, labour, heating and cooling,
and equipment damage. Our insurance premiums could increase, or 
we could face reduced insurability in high risk areas. Furthermore,
this could jeopardize customer satisfaction and may result in a
decrease in revenues. In addition, if average temperatures where
we are operating are warmer or cooler year
-
over
-
year for longer
periods of time, there will be an increasing need for cooling or heating 
capacity in our facilities. This will increase our energy consumption

andassociated operational costs. Furthermore, in order to remain

resilient to these increasing or decreasing temperatures, we would
need to increase our investments in our infrastructure, again leading 
to increased operational costs. 
Ł 
Transition risks are associated with a transition to a lower-carbon
economy, which may include extensive regulatory, technology
and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation
requirements related to climate change. These risks may include
increased operational costs driven by the rising price of energy due 
to carbon pricing regulations and the shifting supply and demand for 
energy, increased operational costs related to e-waste treatment
programs and˝management systems, reputational risks related to

ourmanagement of climate-related issues as well as to our level of 
disclosure related to such matters. There is also a reputational risk of 
not demonstrating our proactive behaviour towards climate change, 
which could affect customer perception and the cost and availability 
of funding that has the potential to be increasingly tied to the quality 
of our ESG practices and related disclosed metrics, all of which could 
have negative ˙nancial outcomes. 
Furthermore, climate-related events could also impact our suppliers
and outsourcers, which in turn could impact our business. Given that 
some of our third-party suppliers and outsourcers are located in foreign 
countries that are more at risk of experiencing weather-related events, 
localized natural disasters in such countries could further negatively
impact our business. 
In addition, several areas of our operations raise other environmental 
considerations, such as fuel storage, GHG emissions and energy
consumption reduction, waste management, disposal of hazardous
residual materials, recovery and recycling of end-of-life electronic
products we sell or lease, and other network associated impacts
(e.g.,˝treated wood poles, manhole efuents, lead cables, etc.). 
Our team members, customers, investors and governments expect that 
we regard environmental protection as an integral part of doing business 
and that we seek to minimize the negative environmental impacts of
our operations and create positive impacts where possible. Failure to 
recognizeand adequately respond to their evolving expectations, to take 
action to reduce our negative impacts on the environment , to achieve 
our environmental objectives and to effectively report on environmental 
matters, could result in ˙nes, and could harm our brand, reputation and 
competitiveness, as well as lead to other negative business, ˙nancial, 
legal and regulatory consequences for the company. 
Pandemics, epidemics and other health risks, including health concerns 
about radiofrequency emissions from wireless communications 
devices and equipment, could have an adverse effect on our business 
Health concerns relatedto COVID-ˆˇ˝stillgive rise to uncertainties, 
and resurgences in new COVID-ˆˇ˝cases and/or the emergence and 
progression of new variants could cause governments to reintroduce 
restrictive measures. Other pandemics, epidemics and health risks 
could also occur, any of which could adversely affect our ability to 
maintain operational networks and provide products and services 
to our customers, as well as the ability of our suppliers to provide us 
with products and services we need to operate our business. Any such 
pandemics, epidemics and other health risks could have an adverse 
effect on the economy and ˙nancial markets resulting in a declining 
level of retail and commercial activity, which could have a negative 
impact on the demand for, and prices of, our products and services. 
Many studies have been performed or are ongoing to assess whether 
mobile communications devices, such as smartphones, as well as 
wireless networks and towers pose a potential health risk. While some 
studies suggest links to certain conditions, others conclude there is no 
established causation between mobile phone usage and adverse health 
effects. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the 
World Health Organization classi˙ed radiofrequency electromagnetic 
˙elds from wireless phones as possibly carcinogenic to humans, but 
also indicated that chance, bias or confounding could not be ruled out 
with reasonable con˙dence. The IARC also called for additional research 
into long-term heavy use of mobile phones. 
ISED is responsible for approving radiofrequency equipment and 
performing compliance assessments and has chosen Health Canada™s 
Safety Code , which sets the limits for safe exposure to radiofrequency 
emissions at home or at work, as its exposure standard. This code 
also out lines safety requirements for the installation and operation of 
devices that emit radiofrequency ˙elds such as mobile communications 
devices, Wi-Fi technologies and base station antennas. ISED has 
made compliance to Safety Code ˝mandatory for all proponents and 
operators of radio installations. 
The following challenges, among others, could result from our business 
being heavily dependent on radiofrequency technologies: 
Ł 
We may face lawsuits relating to alleged adverse health effects on
customers, as well as relating to our marketing and disclosure practices 
in connection therewith, and the likely outcome of such potential
lawsuits is unpredictable and could change over time 
Ł 
Changes in scienti˙c evidence and/or public perceptions could
lead to additional government regulations and costs for retro˙tting

infrastructure and handsets to achieve compliance 
Ł 
Public concerns could result in a slower deployment of, or in our inability 
to deploy, infrastructure necessary to maintain and/or expand our

wireless network as required by market evolution 
Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and 
˙nancial performance.

Various social issues, if not adequately managed, could have an 
adverse effect on our business 
Effective management of social risk is a component of good ESG 
practices. Inadequate management of social issues associated with 
our company and our business, as well as our suppliers and other 
stakeholders, could adversely affect our business, ˙nancial condition, 
liquidity, ˙nancial results and reputation. This may include social issues 
discussed elsewhere in this MD&A such as DEIB, employees™ well-being, 
health and safety, responsible procurement, as well as other social issues 
such as human rights, including Indigenous peoples™ rights, consultation 
and accommodation, and community acceptance and engagement . 
Failure to suf˙ciently address and report on our management of social 
issues and to achieve our social objectives could harm our brand and 
reputation, and could lead to negative business, ˙nancial, legal and 
regulatory consequences for the company. 
There can be no assurance that our corporate governance practices 
will be suf˜cient to prevent violations of legal and ethical standards 
Our employees, of˙cers, Board members, suppliers and other business 
partners are expected to comply with applicable legal and ethical 
standards including, without limitation, anti-bribery laws, as well as 
with our governance policies and contractual obligations. Failure to 
comply with such laws, policies, standards and contractual obligations 
could expose us to investigations or litigation and signi˙cant ˙nes and 
penalties, and result in reputational harm or being disquali˙ed from 
bidding on contracts. While we have developed and implemented 
corporate governance practices, including through our Code of Business 
Conduct which is updated regularly and subject to an annual review 
by our team members, there can be no assurance that such practices 
and measures will be suf˙cient to prevent violations of legal and ethical 
standards. Any such failure or violation could have an adverse effect 
on our business, ˙nancial performance and reputation. 
Various factors could negatively impact our ability to achieve our 
ESG targets 
We have set a number of ambitious ESG targets to monitor our ESG 
performance and align to our strategic imperatives. However, our 
ability to achieve these targets depends on many factors and is subject 
to many risks that could cause our assumptions or estimates to be 
inaccurate and cause actual results or events to differ materially from 
those expressed in, or implied by, these targets. Failure to suf˙ciently 
address evolving employee, customer, investor and other stakeholder 
expectations through achievement of our ESG targets could harm our 
brand, reputation and competitiveness, as well as lead to other negative 
business, ˙nancial, legal and regulatory consequences for the company. 
Important risk factors that could affect certain of our key ESG targets 
are set out below. 
GHG emissions reduction and supplier engagement targets 
The achievement of our carbon neutrality target (which includes only 
ouroperational GHG emissions (scope 
ˆ˝and ˜) and excludes scope˝˛ 
GHG emissions) will require that we purchase a signi˙cant quantity of 
carbon credits and/or  RECs . Should a suf˙cient quantity of high-quality 
credible carbon credits and/or 
RECs 
be unavailable, should their cost 
of acquisition be considered too onerous, should laws, regulations, 
applicable standards, public perception or other factors limit the 
number of carbon credits or 
RECs 
that we can purchase, should any 
purchased carbon credits be subject to reversal, in whole or in part, or 
should the carbon offsets not materialize, the achievement of carbon 
neutrality target could be negatively impacted. 
The achievement of our science-based target related to our scope 
ˆ and ˜ GHG emissions will require that we purchase a signi˙cant 
quantity of  RECs . To achieve this science-based target, only 
RECs 
will be 
considered given that the SBTi standards do not enable carbon credits 
to be used for this target. Should a suf˙cient quantity of acceptable 
(according to the SBTi guidelines) 
RECs 
be unavailable, should their cost 
of acquisition be considered too onerous, or should laws, regulations, 
applicable standards, public perception or other factors limit the number 
ofRECs 
that we can purchase, in whole or in part , the achievement of 
our science-based target related to our scope ˆ and ˜ GHG emissions 
could be negatively impacted. 
A portion of our GHG emissions reduction targets also depend on our 
ability to implement suf˙cient corporate and business initiatives in order 
to reduce GHG emissions to the desired levels. Failure to implement such 
initiatives according to planned schedules due to changes in business 
plans, our inability to implement requisite operational or technological 
changes, unavailability of capital, technologies, equipment or employees, 
cost allocations, actual costs exceeding anticipated costs, or other 
factors, or the failure of such initiatives, including of new technologies, 
to generate anticipated GHG emissions reductions, could negatively 
affect our ability to achieve our GHG emissions reduction targets. In 
addition, future corporate initiatives, such as business acquisitions 
and organic growth, could negatively affect our ability to achieve our 
targets, as would the adoption of new technologies that are carbon 
enablers or do not generate the anticipated energy savings. 
A re˙nement in or modi˙cations to international standards or to the 
methodology we use for the calculation of GHG emissions that would 
result in an increase in our GHG emissions could further impact our ability 
to achieve our targets. In addition, as it relates to our science-based 

targets speci˙cally, the SBTi requires the recalculation of our targets 
upon the occurrence of certain events, such as business acquisitions or 
divestitures, or to conform to evolving SBTi methodology or standards. 
A recalculation resulting in the introduction of more ambitious targets 
could challenge our ability to achieve such updated targets. 
The achievement of our science-based target relating to the level of our 
suppliers by spend covering purchased goods and services that have 
adopted science-based targets could be negatively impacted should we 
fail to achieve the required level of engagement and collaboration from 
our suppliers over which we have no control, despite the engagement 
measures that we may implement , or should we change signi˙cant ly 
the allocation of our spend by supplier. 
In addition, we have much less inuence over the reduction of our 
scope˝˛ GHG emissions than over our scope ˆ and scope ˜ GHG emissions 
given that we must rely on the engagement and collaboration of our 
suppliers and other participants in our value chain in reducing their 
own GHG emissions. Accordingly, failure to obtain our suppliers™ and 
other participants™ engagement and collaboration could adversely 
affect our ability to meet our scope ˛˝GHG emissions reduction target. 
DEIB targets 
Failure to attract and retain a certain level of diverse talent across 
the organization could negatively affect our ability to meet our DEIB 

targets and objectives. In addition, our ability to achieve such targets 
and objectives could also be challenged by reduced labour market

ˆ˚ Accounting policies 
This section discusses key estimates and assumptions that management has made and how they affect the amounts reported in the 
˜nancial statements and notes. It also describes key changes in accounting standards and our accounting policies, and how they affect 
our ˜nancial statements. 
We have prepared our consolidated ˜nancial statements using IFRS. Other signi˜cant accounting policies, not involving the same level of 
measurement uncertainty as those discussed in this section, are nevertheless important to an understanding of our ˜nancial statements. 
See Note˚˛, 
Material accounting policies
, in BCE™s˚˛˝˛˙ consolidated ˜nancial statements for more information about the accounting 
principles we used to prepare our consolidated ˜nancial statements. 
Critical accounting estimates and key judgments 
When preparing the ˙nancial statements, management makes estimates 
and judgments relating to: 
Ł 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
Ł 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
Ł 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
We base our estimates on a number of factors, including but not limited 
to historical experience, current events, economic and ˙nancial market 
conditions such as interest rates, ination and the risk of recession, 

geopolitical events and supply chain disruptions, and actions that the 

company may undertake in the future, as well as other assumptions 
that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. A change in 

these assumptions may have an impact on our ˙nancial statements 
including but not limited to impairment testing, fair value determination, 
expected credit losses and discount rates used for the present value of 
cash ows. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject 
to measurement uncertainty and actual results could differ. Our more 
signi˙cant estimates and judgments are described below. 
We consider the estimates and judgments described in this section to be 
an important part of understanding our ˙nancial statements because 
they require management to make assumptions about matters that 
were highly uncertain at the time the estimates and judgments were 
made, and changes to these estimates and judgments could have a 

material impact on our ˙nancial statements and our segments. 
Our senior management has reviewed the development and selection 
of the critical accounting estimates and judgments described in this 
section with the Audit Committee of the BCE Board. 
Any sensitivity analysis included in this section should be used with 
caution as the changes are hypothetical and the impact of changes in 
each key assumption may not be linear. 
Our more signi˙cant estimates and judgments are described below. 
Estimates 
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment 
andˆnite-life intangible assets 
We review our estimates of the useful lives of property, plant and 
equipment and ˙nite-life intangible assets on an annual basis and 
adjust depreciation or amortization on a prospective basis, as required. 
Property, plant and equipment represent a signi˙cant proportion of 
our total assets. Changes in technology or our intended use of these 
assets, climate change and our environmental, social and corporate 
governance initiatives as well as changes in business prospects or 
economic and industry factors, may cause the estimated useful lives 
of these assets to change. 
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and ˙nite-life 
intangible assets are determined by internal asset life studies, which 
take into account actual and expected future usage, physical wear and 
tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. 
When factors indicate that assets™ useful lives are different from the 
prior assessment, we depreciate or amortize the remaining carrying 
value prospectively over the adjusted estimated useful lives. 
Post-employment benet plans 
The amounts reported in the ˙nancial statements relating to DB pension 
plans and OPEBs are determined using actuarial calculations that are 
based on several assumptions. 
Our actuaries perform a valuation at least every three years to determine 
the actuarial present value of the accrued DB pension plan and OPEB 
obligations. The actuarial valuation uses management™s assumptions 
for, among other things, the discount rate, life expectancy, the rate of 
compensation increase, cost of living indexation rate, trends in healthcare 
costs and expected average remaining years of service of employees. 
While we believe that these assumptions are reasonable, differences 
in actual results or changes in assumptions could materially affect 
post-employment bene˙t obligations and future net post-employment 
bene˙t plans cost . 
We account for differences between actual and expected results 
in bene˙t obligations and plan performance in OCI, which are then 
recognized immediately in the de˙cit . 
The most signi˙cant assumptions used to calculate the net post-
employment bene˙t plans cost are the discount rate and life expectancy. 
A discount rate is used to determine the present value of the future 
cash ows that we expect will be needed to sett le post-employment 
bene˙t obligations. 
The discount rate is based on the yield on long-term, high-quality 
corporate ˙xed income investments, with maturities matching the 
estimated cash ows of the post-employment bene˙t plans. Life 
expectancy is based on publicly available Canadian mortality tables 
and is adjusted for the company™s speci˙c experience. 
A lower discount rate and a higher life expectancy result in a higher net 
post-employment bene˙t obligation and a higher current service cost.

Revenue from contracts with customers 
We are required to make estimates that affect the amount of revenue 
from contracts with customers, including estimating the stand-alone 
selling prices of products and services. 
For bundled arrangements, we account for individual products and 
serviceswhen they are sep
arately identi˙able and the customer can 
bene˙t from the product or service on its own or with other readily 
available resources. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to 
each product or service included in the contract with the customer based 
on its stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone 
selling prices based on the observable prices at which we sell products 
separately without a service contract and prices for non-bundled 
service offers with the same range of services, adjusted for market 
conditions and other factors, as appropriate. When similar products 
and services are not sold separately, we use the expected cost plus 

margin approach to determine stand-alone selling prices. Products 

and services purchased by a customer in excess of those included in 
the bundled arrangement are accounted for separately. 
Impairment of non-nancial assets 
Goodwill and inde˙nite-life intangible assets are tested for impairment 
annually or when there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Property, plant and equipment and ˙nite-life intangible assets are tested 
for impairment if events or changes in circumstances, assessed at 
each reporting period, indicate that their carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets other than 
goodwill are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately 
identi˙able cash inows. 
Impairment losses are recognized and measured as the excess of the 
carrying value of the assets over their recoverable amount. An asset™s 
recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal 
and its value in use. Previously recognized impairment losses, other than 
those attributable to goodwill, are reviewed for possible reversal at each 
reporting date and, if the asset™s recoverable amount has increased, 

all or a portion of the impairment is reversed. 
We make a number of estimates when calculating recoverable amounts 
using discounted future cash ows or other valuation methods to test 
for impairment . These estimates include the assumed growth rates for 
future cash ows, the number of years used in the cash ow model and 
the discount rate. When impairment charges occur they are recorded 
in 
Impairment of assets
. 
During the fourth quarter of ˜˚˜˛, we recognized $˝million of 
impairment charges for French TV channels within our Bell Media 
segment . The impairment charges were the result of a reduction in 
advertising demand in the industry resulting from economic uncertainties 
and unfavourable impacts to market-based valuation assumptions. 
These charges included $ˆ million allocated to inde˙nite-life intangible 
assets for broadcast licences and brands, and $˝million to ˙nite-life 
intangible assets for program and feature ˙lm rights. The impairment 
was determined by comparing the carrying value of the cash generating 
units (CGUs) to their fair value less cost of disposal. We estimated the 
fair value of the CGUs using both discounted cash ows and market-
based valuation models, which include ˙ve-year cash ow projections 
derived from business plans reviewed by senior management for the 
period of October ˆ, ˜˚˜˛ to December ˛ˆ, ˜˚˜, using a discount rate 
of 
ˇ.% and a perpetuity growth rate of ˚.˚%. After impairments, the 

carrying value of our impacted CGU was $˜˝million. 
Additionally in ˜˚˜˛, we recorded impairment charges of $˝million 
related mainly to right-of-use assets for certain of˙ce spaces we 
ceased using as part of our real estate optimization strategy as a result 
of our hybrid work policy. 
There was no impairment of Bell Media goodwill. 
During the fourth quarter of ˜˚˜˜, we recognized $ˆ˝million of 
impairment charges for French TV channels within our Bell Media 
segment . The impairment charges were the result of a reduction in

charges included $ˇ˝million allocated to inde˙nite-life intangible assets 
for broadcast licences, and $˛˝million to ˙nite-life intangible assets for 
program and feature ˙lm rights. The impairment was determined by 
comparing the carrying value of the CGUs to their fair value less cost of 
disposal. We estimated the fair value of the CGUs using the discounted 
cash ow valuation models, which include ˙ve-year cash ow projections 
derived from business plans reviewed by senior management for the 
period of October˝ˆ,˝˜˚˜˜ to December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜, using a discount rate 
of ˆ˚.˛% and a perpetuity growth rate of ˚.%. After impairments, the 

carrying value of our impacted CGUs was $ˆ˚ˇ˝million. 
Additionally in ˜˚˜˜, we recorded impairment charges of $ˆ˛˜˝million 
related mainly to right-of-use assets for certain of˙ce spaces we 
ceased using as part of our real estate optimization strategy as a result 
of our hybrid work policy.

Goodwill impairment testing 
We perform an annual test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter 
for each of our CGUs or groups of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated, 
and whenever there is an indication that goodwill might be impaired. 
A CGU is the smallest identi˙able group of assets that generates cash 
inowsthat are 
independent of the cash inows from other assets or 
groups of assets. 
We identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value 
of a CGU or group of CGUs to its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount of a CGU or group of CGUs is the higher of its fair value less 
costs of disposal and its value in use. Both fair value less costs of disposal 
and value in use are based on estimates of discounted future cash 
ows or other valuation methods. Cash ows are projected based on 
past experience, actual operating results and business plans, including 
any impact from changes in interest rates and ination. When the 
recoverable amount of a CGU or group of CGUs is less than its carrying 
value, the recoverable amount is determined for its identi˙able assets 
and liabilities. The excess of the recoverable amount of the CGU or 
group of CGUs over the total of the amounts assigned to its assets and 
liabilities is the recoverable amount of goodwill. 
An impairment charge is recognized in 
Impairment of assets 
in the 
income statements for any excess of the carrying value of goodwill 
over its recoverable amount . For purposes of impairment testing of 
goodwill, our CGUs or groups of CGUs correspond to our reporting 
segments as disclosed in Note˝˛, 
Segmented information
, in BCE™s˝˜˚˜˛ 
consolidated ˙nancial statements. 
Any signi˙cant change in each of the estimates used could have a 
material impact on the calculation of the recoverable amount and 
resulting impairment charge. As a result, we are unable to reasonably 
quantify the changes in our overall ˙nancial performance if we had 
used different assumptions. 
We cannot predict whether an event that triggers impairment will occur, 
when it will occur or how it will affect the asset values we have reported. 
We believe that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions 
on which the estimate of recoverable amount of the Bell CTS group 

of CGUs is based would not cause its carrying amount to exceed its 
recoverable amount . 
For the Bell Media group of CGUs, a decrease of (˚.˛%) in the perpetuity 
growth rate or an increase of ˚.˜% in the discount rate would have 
resulted in its recoverable amount being equal to its carrying value. 
There were no goodwill impairment charges in˝˜˚˜˛ or ˜˚˜˜. 
Deferred taxes 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply when the asset or liability is recovered or settled. 
Both our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at 
the reporting date. 
Deferred taxes are provided on temporary differences arising from 
investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates, except 
where we control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
The amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities are estimated with 
consideration given to the timing, sources and amounts of future 
taxable income. 
Leases 
The application of IFRS˝ˆ requires us to make estimates that affect the 
measurement of right-of-use assets and liabilities, including determining 
the appropriate discount rate used to measure lease liabilities. Lease 
liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments 
that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using our 
incremental borrowing rate, unless the rate implicit in the lease is 
readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is derived from 
publicly available risk-free interest rates, adjusted for applicable credit 
spreads and lease terms. We apply a single incremental borrowing rate 
to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics. 
Fair value of nancial instruments 
Certain ˙nancial instruments, such as investments in equity securities, 
derivative ˙nancial instruments and certain elements of borrowings, are 
carried in the statements of ˙nancial position at fair value, with changes 
in fair value reected in the income statements and the statements 
of comprehensive income. Fair values are estimated by reference to 
published price quotations or by using other valuation techniques that 
may include inputs that are not based on observable market data, such 
as discounted cash ows and earnings multiples. 
Contingencies 
In the ordinary course of business, we become involved in various 
claims and legal proceedings seeking monetary damages and other 
relief. Pending claims and legal proceedings represent a potential cost 
to our business. We estimate the amount of a loss by analyzing potential 
outcomes and assuming various litigation and settlement strategies, 
based on information that is available at the time. 
If the ˙nal resolution of a legal or regulatory matter results in a judgment 
against us or requires us to pay a large sett lement, it could have a 

material adverse effect on our consolidated ˙nancial statements in 
the period in which the judgment or sett lement occurs. 
Onerous contracts 
A provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the unavoidable 
costs of meeting our obligations under a contract exceed the expected 
bene˙ts to be received under the contract . The provision is measured 

at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating 
the contract and the expected net cost of completing the contract . 
Judgments 
Post-employment benet plans 
The determination of the discount rate used to value our post-
employment bene˙t obligations requires judgment . The rate is set by 
reference to market yields of long-term, high-quality corporate ˙xed 
income investments at the beginning of each ˙scal year. Signi˙cant 
judgment is required when setting the criteria for ˙xed income 
investments to be included in the population from which the yield curve 
is derived. The most signi˙cant criteria considered for the selection of 

investments include the size of the issue and credit quality, along with 
the identi˙cation of out liers, which are excluded.

Income taxes 
The calculation of income taxes requires judgment in interpreting tax rules 
and regulations. There are transactions and calculations for which the 
ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our tax ˙lings are also subject 
to audits, the outcome of which could change the amount of current 
and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Management believes that it 
has suf˙cient amounts accrued for outstanding tax matters based on 
information that current ly is available. 
Managementjudgmentisusedtodeterminetheamountsofdeferredtax 
assets and liabilities to be recognized. In particular, judgment is required 
when assessing the timing of the reversal of temporary differences to 
which future income tax rates are applied. 
Leases 
The application of IFRS˝ˆ requires us to make judgments that affect 
the measurement of right-of-use assets and liabilities. A lease contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an identi˙ed asset for a period 
of time in exchange for consideration. At inception of the contract, we 
assess whether the contract contains an identi˙ed asset, whether 
we˝have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic bene˙ts 
from use of the asset and whether we have the right to direct how and 
for what purpose the asset is used. In determining the lease term, we 
include periods covered by renewal options when we are reasonably 
certain to exercise those options. Similarly, we include periods covered 
by termination options when we are reasonably certain not to exercise 
those options. To assess if we are reasonably certain to exercise an 
option, we consider all facts and circumstances that create an economic 
incentive to exercise renewal options (or not exercise termination 
options).Economicincentivesincludethecostsrelatedto thetermination 
of the lease, the signi˙cance of any leasehold improvements and the 
importance of the underlying assets to our operations. 
Revenue from contracts with customers 
The identi˙cation of performance obligations within a contract and 
the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations under long-term 
contractsrequiresjudgment.For bundledarrangements,we accountfor 
individual products and services when they are separately identi˙able 
and the customer can bene˙t from the product or service on its own or 
with other readily available resources. When our right to consideration 
from a customer corresponds directly with the value to the customer of 
the products and services transferred to date, we recognize revenue in 
the amount to which we have a right to invoice. We recognize product 
revenues from the sale of wireless handsets and devices and wireline 
equipment when a customer takes possession of the product. We 
recognize service revenues over time, as the services are provided. 
Revenues on certain long-term contracts are recognized using output 
methods based on products delivered, performance completed to date, 
time elapsed or milestones met . 
Additionally, the determination of costs to obtain a contract, including the 
identi˙cation of incremental costs, also requires judgment. Incremental 
costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, principally comprised of 
sales commissions, and prepaid contract ful˙llment costs are included 
in 
Contract costs
 in the statements of ˙nancial position, except where 
the amortization period is one year or less, in which case costs of 
obtaining a contract are immediately expensed. Capitalized costs are 
amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the period and 
pattern of transfer to the customer of the related products or services. 
CGUs 
Thedeterminationof CGUsor groupsofCGUsfor thepurposeof 
impairment testing requires judgment . 
Contingencies 
The determination of whether a loss is probable from claims and legal 
proceedings and whether an outow of resources is likely requires 
judgment . 
We accrue a potential loss if we believe a loss is probable and an outow 
of resources is likely and can be reasonably estimated, based on 
information that is available at the time. Any accrual would be charged 
to earnings and included in 
Trade payables and other liabilities
 or 
Other 
non-current liabilities
. Any payment as a result of a judgment or cash 
settlement would be deducted from cash from operating activities. We 
estimate the amount of a loss by analyzing potential outcomes and 
assuming various litigation and sett lement strategies.

ˆˆ Non-GAAP ˙nancial measures,  
other ˙nancial me asures and  
key˝performance indicators (KPIs)
BCE uses various ˙nancial measures to assess its business performance. 
Certain of these measures are calculated in accordance with IFRS 
or GAAP while certain other measures do not have a standardized 
meaning under GAAP. We believe that our GAAP ˙nancial measures, 
read together with adjusted non-GAAP and other ˙nancial measures, 
provide readers with a better understanding of how management 
assesses BCE™s performance. 
National Instrument ˜-ˆˆ˜, 
Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures 
Disclosure
 (NI ˜-ˆˆ˜), prescribes disclosure requirements that apply 
to the following speci˙ed ˙nancial measures: 
Ł 
Non-GAAP ˙nancial measures; 
Ł 
Non-GAAP ratios; 
Ł 
Total of segments measures; 
Ł 
Capital management measures; and 
Ł 
Supplementary ˙nancial measures. 
This section provides a description and classi˙cation of the speci˙ed 
˙nancial measures contemplated by NI ˜-ˆˆ˜˝that we use to explain our 
˙nancial results except that, for supplementary ˙nancial measures, an 
explanation of such measures is provided where they are ˙rst referred 
to in this MD& A if the supplementary ˙nancial measures™ labelling is 
not suf˙ciently descriptive. 
ˆˆ.ˆ 
 
Non-GA AP ˙na ncial measures 
A non-GAAP ˙nancial measure is a ˙nancial measure used to depict our 
historical or expected future ˙nancial performance, ˙nancial position or 
cash ow and, with respect to its composition, either excludes an amount 
that is included in, or includes an amount that is excluded from, the 
composition of the most directly comparable ˙nancial measure disclosed 
in BCE™s consolidated primary ˙nancial statements. We believe that 
non-GAAP ˙nancial measures are reective of our ongoing operating 
results and provide readers with an understanding of management™s 
perspective on and analysis of our performance. 
Below are descriptions of the non-GAAP ˙nancial measures that we 
use to explain our results as well as reconciliations to the most directly 
comparable IFRS ˙nancial measures. 
Adjuste d net earnings 
The term adjusted net earnings does not have any standardized meaning 
under IFRS. Therefore, it is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures 
presented by other issuers. 
We de˙ne adjusted net earnings as net earnings attributable to common 
to-market losses (gains) on derivatives used to economically hedge 
equity settled share-based compensation plans, net equity losses (gains) 
on investments in associates and joint ventures, net losses (gains) on 
investments, early debt redemption costs, impairment of assets and 
discontinued operations, net of tax and NCI. 
We use adjusted net earnings and we believe that certain investors and 
analysts use this measure, among other ones, to assess the performance 
of our businesses without the effects of severance, acquisition and 
other costs, net mark-to-market losses (gains) on derivatives used 
to economically hedge equity settled share-based compensation 
plans, net equity losses (gains) on investments in associates and joint 
ventures, net losses (gains) on investments, early debt redemption costs, 
impairment of assets and discontinued operations, net of tax and NCI. 
We exclude these items because they affect the comparability of our 
˙nancial results and could potentially distort the analysis of trends in 
business performance. Excluding these items does not imply they are 

non-recurring. 
The most directly comparable IFRS ˙nancial measure is net earnings 
attributable to common shareholders.

Adjuste d net interest expense 
The term adjusted net interest expense does not have any standardized 
meaning under IFRS. Therefore, it is unlikely to be comparable to similar 
measures presented by other issuers. 
We de˙ne adjusted net interest expense as twelve-month trailing net 
interest expense as shown in our consolidated statements of cash 
ows, plus ˚% of twelve-month trailing net earnings attributable to 
preferred shareholders as shown in our consolidated income statements. 
A
djusted net interest expense 
is
 a component in the calculation of 
the adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net interest expense ratio, which is 
a capital management measure. For further details on the adjusted 
EBITDA to adjusted net interest expense ratio, see section ˆˆ.,˝
Capital 
management measures
. 
In˝˜˚˜˜ and ˜˚˜˛, we used, and believe that 
certain investors and analysts used, the adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net 
interest expense ratio, among other measures, to evaluate the ˙nancial 
health of the company. However, given the correlation between this 
ratio and the net debt leverage ratio, we are simplifying our internal 
targets to reect the net debt leverage ratio only and will not rep
ort 
against adjusted EBITD
A to adjusted net interest expense in the future. 
We believe that this ratio is of less relative importance to our investors, 
lenders and other stakeholders as a measure of the strength of our 
capital structure.

expense. The following table is a reconciliation of net interest expense

Available liquidity 
The term available liquidity does not have any standardized meaning 
under IFRS. Therefore, it is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures 
presented by other issuers. 
We de˙ne available liquidity as cash, cash equivalents, short-term 
investments and amounts available under our securitized receivables 
program and our committed bank credit facilities, excluding credit 
facilities that are available exclusively for a pre-determined purpose. 
In Q˝˜˚˜˛, we updated our de˙nition of available liquidity to account 
for short-term investments as these funds are liquid and can be used to 
meet our cash requirements. This change does not impact the available 
liquidity amounts previously presented. 
We consider available liquidity to be an important indicator of the 
˙nancial strength and performance of our businesses because it shows 
the funds available to meet our cash requirements, including for, but 
not limited to, capital expenditures, post-employment bene˙t plans 
funding, dividend payments, the payment of contractual obligations, 
maturing debt, ongoing operations, the acquisition of spectrum, and other 
cash requirements. We believe that certain investors and analysts use

Free cash ow and excess free cash ow 
The terms free cash ow and excess free cash ow do not have any 
standardized meaning under IFRS. Therefore, they are unlikely to be 
comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. 
We de˙ne free cash ow as cash ows from operating activities, 
excluding cash from discontinued operations, acquisition and other 
costs paid (which include signi˙cant litigation costs) and voluntary 
pension funding, less capital expenditures, preferred share dividends and 
dividends paid by subsidiaries to NCI. We exclude cash from discontinued 
operations, acquisition and other costs paid and voluntary pension 
funding because they affect the comparability of our ˙nancial results and 
could potentially distort the analysis of trends in business performance. 
Excluding these items does not imply they are non-recurring. 
We de˙ne excess free cash ow as free cash ow less dividends paid 
on common shares. 
We consider free cash ow and excess free cash ow to be important 
indicators of the ˙nancial strength and performance of our businesses. 
Free cash ow shows how much cash is available to pay dividends 
on common shares, repay debt and reinvest in our company. Excess 
free cash ow shows how much cash is available to repay debt and 
reinvest in our company, after the payment of dividends on common 
shares. We believe that certain investors and analysts use free cash 
ow and excess free cash ow to value a business and its underlying 
assets and to evaluate the ˙nancial strength and performance of our 

businesses. The most direct ly comparable IFRS ˙nancial measure is

Net debt 
The term net debt does not have any standardized meaning under 
IFRS. Therefore, it is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures 
presented by other issuers. 
We de˙ne netdebt as debt due within one year plus long-term debt and 
˚% of preferred shares, less cash, cash equivalents and short-term 
investments, as shown in BCE™s consolidated statements of ˙nancial 
position. We include ˚% of outstanding preferred shares in our net 
debt as it is consistent with the treatment by certain credit rating 
agencies. In Q ˜˚˜˛, we updated our de˙nition of net debt to account 
for short-term investments as these funds are liquid and may be used 
to repay the debt due within one year. This change does not impact the 
net debt amounts previously presented. 
We consider net debt to be an important indicator of the company™s 
˙nancial leverage because it represents the amount of debt that is not 
covered by available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
We believe that certain investors and analysts use net debt to determine 
a company™s ˙nancial leverage. 
Net debt is calculated using several asset and liability categories from 
the statements of ˙nancial position. The most directly comparable IFRS 
˙nancial measure is long-term debt . The following table is a reconciliation

In addition to the non-GAAP ˙nancial measures and other ˙nancial measures described previously, we use the following KPIs to measure the 
success of our strategic imperatives. These KPIs are not accounting measures and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by 
other issuers. 
KPI	 
De˜nition 
Adjusted EBITDA margin 
Adjusted EBITDA margin is de˙ned as adjusted EBITDA divided by operating revenues. 
ARPU	 
Effective Qˆ˝˜˚˜˛, as a result of the segment reporting changes impacting intersegment eliminations, ARPU has been updated and 
 
is de˙ned as Bell CTS wireless external services revenues (previously wireless operating service revenues) divided by the average 
 
mobile phone subscriber base for the speci˙ed period, expressed as a dollar unit per month. 
Capital intensity 
Capital intensity is de˙ned as capital expenditures divided by operating revenues. 
Churn	 
Mobile phone churn is the rate at which existing mobile phone subscribers cancel their services. It is a measure of our ability 
 
to˝retain our customers. Mobile phone churn is calculated by dividing the number of mobile phone deactivations during a given 
 
period by the average number of mobile phone subscribers in the base for the speci˙ed period and is expressed as a percentage 
 
per month. 
Subscriber unit	 
Mobile phone subscriber unit is comprised of a recurring revenue-generating portable unit (e.g. smartphones and feature phones) 
 
on an active service plan, that has access to our wireless networks and includes v
oice, text and/or data connectivity. We report 
 
mobile phone subscriber units in two categories: p
ostpaid and prepaid. Prepaid mobile phone subscriber units are considered 
 
active for a period of ˇ˚˝days following the expiry of the subscriber™s prepaid balance. 
Mobile connected device subscriber unit is comprised of a recurring revenue-generating portable unit (e.g. tablets, wearables, 
 
mobile Internet devices and IoT) on an active service plan, that has access to our wireless networks and is intended for limited 
 
 
or no cellular voice cap
ability. 
Wireline subscriber unit consists of an active revenue-generating unit with access to our services, including retail Internet, 
 
 
satellite TV, IPTV, and/or residential NAS. A subscriber is included in our subscriber base when the service has been installed 
 
 
and is operational at the customer premise and a billing relationship has been established. 
Ł
 
Retail Internet, IPTV and satellite TV subscribers have access to stand-alone services, and are primarily represented 
 
 
by a dwelling unit 
Ł
 
Retail residential NAS subscribers are based on a line count and are represented by a unique telephone number

periods speci˙ed under those laws, and include controls and procedures 
that are designed to ensure that the information is accumulated and 
communicated to management, including BCE™s President and CEO and 
Executive Vice-President and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding 
required disclosure. 
As at December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˛, management evaluated, under the supervision

reporting and the preparation of ˙nancial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. However, 
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over ˙nancial 
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. 
Management evaluated, under the supervision of and with the

Reports on int ernal controls 
Management ™s report on internal control over ˜nancial reporting 
The management of BCE˝Inc. (BCE) is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining adequate internal control over ˙nancial reporting. Our 
internal control over ˙nancial reporting is a process designed under 
the supervision of the President and Chief Executive Of˙cer and the

board of directors, management and other personnel of BCE, to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of ˙nancial reporting 
and the preparation of ˙nancial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over ˙nancial reporting 
may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control 
over ˙nancial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, 

or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may

Report of independent registere d public accounting ˜rm 
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of BCE˝Inc. 
Opinion on internal control over
˜nancial reporting 
We have audited the internal control over ˙nancial reporting of BCE˝Inc. 
and subsidiaries (the ﬁCompanyﬂ) as of December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˛, based on 
criteria established in 
 Internal Control Œ Integrated Framework (ˇ˚ˆ) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all 
material respects, effective internal control over ˙nancial reporting as 
of December˝˛ˆ,˝˜˚˜˛ based on criteria established in 
Internal Control˘Œ 
Integrated Framework (ˇ˚ˆ)
 issued by COSO. 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) the 
consolidated ˙nancial statements as at and for the year ended 
December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˛, of the Company and our report dated March˝, 
˜˚˜, expressed an unquali˙ed opinion on those ˙nancial statements. 
Basis for opinion 
The Company™s management is responsible for maintaining effective 
internal control over ˙nancial reporting and for its assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal control over ˙nancial reporting, included in the 
accompanying Management™s Report on Internal Control over Financial 
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company™s 
internal control over ˙nancial reporting based on our audit . We are a 
public accounting ˙rm registered with the PCAOB and are required to 
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the 
 
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of 
 
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over 
˙nancial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit 
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over ˙nancial 
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control 
based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as 
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our 
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
De˜nition and limitations of internal control 

over˚˜nancial reporting 
A company™s internal control over ˙nancial reporting is a process 
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of ˙nancial reporting and the preparation of ˙nancial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company™s internal control over ˙nancial reporting includes 
those policies and procedures that (ˆ) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (˜) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary 
to permit preparation of ˙nancial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance 
with authorizations of˝management and directors of the company; 
and (˛)˝provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company™s 
assets that could have a material effect on the ˙nancial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over ˙nancial 
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to 
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.

Management ™s responsibility for ˜nancial reporting 
These ˙nancial statements form the basis for all of the ˙nancial 
information that appears in this report . 
The ˙nancial statements and all of the information in this report are 
the responsibility of the management of BCE˝
Inc. (BCE) and have been 
reviewed and approved by the board of directors. The board of directors 
is responsible for ensuring that management ful˙lls its ˙nancial reporting 
responsibilities. Deloitte LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting 
Firm, have audited the ˙nancial statements. 
Management has prepared the ˙nancial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board. Under these principles, 
management has made certain estimates and assumptions that are 
reected in the ˙nancial statements and notes. Management believes 
that these ˙nancial statements fairly present BCE™s consolidated ˙nancial 
position, results of operations and cash ows. 
Management has a system of internal controls designed to provide 
reasonable assurance that the ˙nancial statements are accurate and 
complete in all material respects. This is supported by an internal audit 
group that reports to the Audit Committee, and includes communication 
with employees about policies for ethical business conduct. Management 
believes that the internal controls provide reasonable assurance that 
our ˙nancial records are reliable and form a proper basis for preparing 
the ˙nancial statements, and that our assets are properly accounted 
for and safeguarded. 
The board of directors has appointed an Audit Committee, which is 
made up of unrelated and independent directors. The Audit Committee™s 
responsibilities include reviewing the ˙nancial statements and other 
information in this report, and recommending them to the board 
of directors for approval. You will ˙nd a description of the Audit 
Committee™s other responsibilities in this report . The internal auditors 
and the shareholders™ auditors have free and independent access to 
the Audit Committee.

Report of independent registere d public accounting ˜rm 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of BCE˝Inc. 
Opinion on the 
˜
nancial 
s
tatements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of 
˙nancial position of BCE˝Inc. and subsidiaries (the ﬁCompanyﬂ) as 
at December˝˛ˆ,˝ ˜˚˜˛ and ˜˚˜˜, the related consolidated income 
statements, statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity, and 
cash ows, for each of the two years in the period ended December˝˛ˆ, 
˜˚˜˛, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ﬁ˙nancial 
statementsﬂ). In our opinion, the ˙nancial statements present fairly, 
in all material respects, the ˙nancial position of the Company as at 
December˝˛ˆ,˝˜˚˜˛ and ˜˚˜˜, and its ˙nancial performance and its 
cash ows for each of the two years in the period ended December˝˛ˆ, 
˜˚˜˛, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 
Company™s internal control over ˙nancial reporting as of December˝˛ˆ, 
˜˚˜˛, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control Œ Integrated 
Framework (ˇ˚ˆ)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March˝, ˜˚˜, 
expressed an unquali˙ed opinion on the Company™s internal control 
over ˙nancial reporting. 
Basis for 
o
pinion 
These ˙nancial statements are the responsibility of the Company™s 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company™s ˙nancial statements based on our audits. We are a public 
accounting ˙rm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. 
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the 
PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ˙nancial statements 
are free of material misstatement , whether due to error or fraud. Our 

audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the ˙nancial statements, whether due to error or 
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such 
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding 
the amounts and disclosures in the ˙nancial statements. Our audits 
also included evaluating the accounting principles used and signi˙cant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the ˙nancial statements. We believe that our audits 

provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the 
current-period audit of the ˙nancial statements that was communicated 
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (ˆ) 
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the ˙nancial 
statements and (˜) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or 
complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does 
not alter in any way our opinion on the ˙nancial statements, taken as 
a whole, and we are not , by communicating the critical audit matter

Critical Audit Matter Description 
Goodwill and inde˙nite-life intangible assets for the Bell Media group 
of cash generating units (ﬁBell Mediaﬂ) are tested annually or when 
there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. As a result of the 
annual assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for 
Bell Media, management has determined that there is no impairment 
of goodwill and there is an impairment for intangible assets relating 
to the French TV channels. 
When testing goodwill and intangible assets for Bell Media, while there 
are several assumptions that are required to determine the recoverable 
amount, the judgments with the highest degree of subjectivity and 
impact, are the operating cash ow projections, and the determination 
of discount rates and perpetuity growth rates (ﬁsigni˙cant assumptionsﬂ). 
Changes in these signi˙cant assumptions could have a signi˙cant impact 
on the recoverable amount of Bell Media, resulting in an impairment 

charge to goodwill and/or intangible assets as required. Auditing the 
signi˙cant assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment 
and an increased extent of audit effort, which included the involvement 
of fair value specialists. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
Our audit procedures related to the signi˙cant assumptions used by 
management to determine the recoverable amount for Bell Media 
included the following, among others: 
Ł 
Evaluated the effectiveness of controls over the assessment of 
goodwill and intangible assets for impairment , including those over 

the signi˙cant assumptions
; 
Ł 
Evaluated management™s ability to accurately 
project 
future operating 
cash ows by comparing actual results to management™s historical 

projections
; 
Ł 
Evaluated the reasonableness of management™s operating cash ow 
projections by comparing the 
projections to: 
Ł 
Historical operating cash ows; 
Ł 
Analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its 
peer companies, and other relevant publicly available information; 
Ł 
Known changes in Bell Media™s operations and the industry in 
which it operates, and the current economic uncertainty from 
inationary pressures, which are expected to impact future operating 
performance; 
Ł 
Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors
; 
Ł 
With the assistance of fair value specialists, evaluated the 
reasonableness of the (ˆ) discount rates, and (˜) perpetuity growth 

rates by: 
Ł 
Testing the source information underlying the determination of the 
discount rates; 
Ł 
Reviewing relevant internal and external information, including 
analyst and industry reports, to assess the reasonability of the 
selected discount rates and perpetuity growth rates; 
Ł 
Developing
 range
s
 of independent estimates and comparing those 
to the discount rates and perpetuity growth rates selected by 
management .

We
, 
us
, 
our
, 
BCE
 and 
the company
 mean, as the context may require, either BCE˚Inc. or, collectively, BCE˚Inc., Bell Canada, their subsidiaries, 
joint arrangements and associates. 
NOTE ˝ 
Corporate infor mation 
BCE is incorporated and domiciled in Canada. BCE™s head of˙ce is located at ˆ, Carrefour Alexander-Graham-Bell, Verdun, Québec, Canada. 
BCE is a communications company providing wireless, wireline, Internet and television (TV) services to residential, business and wholesale 
customers in Canada. Our Bell Media segment provides conventional TV, specialty TV, pay TV, streaming services, digital media services, radio 
broadcasting services and out-of-home (OOH) advertising services to customers in Canada. The consolidated ˙nancial statements (˙nancial 
statements) were approved by BCE™s board of directors on March˝, ˜˚˜. 
NOTEˆ˜ 
Materia l accounting policies 
A) Basis of present ation 
The ˙nancial statements were prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The ˙nancial statements have 
been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain ˙nancial 
instruments that are measured at fair value as described in our 
accounting policies. 
All amounts are in millions of Canadian dollars, except where noted. 
Functional currency 
The ˙nancial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, the 
company™s functional currency. 
B) Basis of consolidation 
We consolidate the ˙nancial statements of all of our subsidiaries. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are consolidated from the date of acquisition and the results of subsidiaries sold during the 
year are deconsolidated from the date of disposal. Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
C) Revenue from contracts with customers 
Revenue is measured based on the value of the expected consideration in 
a contract with a customer and excludes sales taxes and other amounts 
we collect on behalf of third parties. We recognize revenue when control 
of a product or service is transferred to a customer. When our right 
to consideration from a customer corresponds directly with the value 
to the customer of the products and services transferred to date, we 
recognize revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice. 
For bundled arrangements, we account for individual products and 
services 
when they are separately identi˙able and the customer can 
bene˙t from the product or service on its own or with other readily 
available resources. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to 
each product or service included in the contract with the customer based 
on its stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone 
selling prices based on the observable prices at which we sell products 
separately without a service contract and prices for non-bundled 
service offers with the same range of services, adjusted for market 
conditions and other factors, as appropriate. When similar products 
and services are not sold separately, we use the expected cost plus 
margin approach to determine stand-alone selling prices. Products 

and services purchased by a customer in 
excess of those included in 
the bundled arrangement are accounted for separately. 
We may enter into arrangements with subcontractors and others 
who provide services to our customers. When we act as the principal 
in these arrangements, we recognize revenues based on the amounts 
billed to our customers. Otherwise, we recognize the net amount that 
we retain as revenues. 
A contract asset is recognized in the consolidated statements of 
˙nancial position (statements of ˙nancial position) when our right to 
consideration from the transfer of products or services to a customer 
is conditional on our obligation to transfer other products or services. 
Contract assets are transferred to trade receivables when our right 
to consideration becomes conditional only as to the passage of time. 
A contract liability is recognized in the statements of ˙nancial position 
when we receive consideration in advance of the transfer of products 
or services to the customer. Contract assets and liabilities relating to 
the same contract are presented on a net basis.

 in the statements of ˙nancial position, 
except where the amortization period is one year or less, in which case 
costs of obtaining a contract are immediately expensed. Capitalized 

costs are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the 
period and pattern of transfer to the customer of the related products 
or services. 
Bell 
C
ommunication and 
T
echnology 
S
ervices
(Bell CTS) segment revenues 
We recognize product revenues from the sale of equipment when 
a customer takes possession of the product. We recognize service 
revenues over time, as the services are provided. Revenues on certain 
long-term contracts are recognized using output methods based on 
products delivered, performance completed to date, time elapsed or 
milestones met . 
For wireless products and services that are sold separately, customers 
usually pay in full at the time of sale for products and on a monthly 
basis for services. For wireless products and services sold in bundled 
arrangements, including device ˙nancing plans, customers pay monthly 
over a contract term of up to ˜˝months for residential customers and 
up to ˛˝months for business customers. If they include a signi˙cant 
˙nancing component, device ˙nancing plan receivables are discounted 
at market rates and interest revenue is accreted over the contractual 

repayment period. 
For wireline customers, products are usually paid in full at the time of 
sale. Services are paid for on a monthly basis except where 
a billing 
schedule has been established with certain business customers under 
long-term contracts that can generally extend up to seven years. 
Bell Media segment revenues 
We recognize advertising revenue when advertisements are aired on 
the radio or TV, posted on our websites or appear on our advertising 
panels and street furniture. Revenues relating to subscriber fees are 
recorded on a monthly basis as the services are provided. Customer 
payments are due monthly as the services are provided. 
See Note˝˛, 
Segmented information
, for additional details. 
D) S hare-bas e d payments 
Our share-based payment arrangements include an employee savings 
plan (ESP), restricted share units (RSUs) and performance share units 
(PSUs), deferred share units (DSUs) and stock options. 
ESP 
We recognize our ESP contributions as compensation expense in 
Operating costs
 in the consolidated income statements (income 
statements) over the two-year vesting period, with a corresponding 
credit to contributed surplus. The value of an ESP at the grant date is 
equal to the value of one BCE common share. Additional ESPs are issued 
to reect dividends declared on the common shares. Upon settlement 
of shares under the ESP, any difference between the cost of shares 
purchased on the open market and the amount credited to contributed 
surplus is reected in the de˙cit . 
RSUs/PSUs 
For each RSU/PSU granted, we recognize compensation expense in 
Operating costs
 in the income statements over the three-year vesting 
period, with a corresponding credit to contributed surplus. The value of 
a RSU/PSU at the grant date is equal to the value of one BCE common 
share or the value estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation for PSUs 
that include relative total shareholder return as a performance condition. 
Additional RSUs/PSUs are issued to reect dividends declared on the 
common shares. 
Upon sett lement of the RSUs/PSUs, any difference between the cost 
of shares purchased on the open market and the amount credited to 

contributed surplus is reected in the de˙cit
. Vested RSUs/PSUs are 
sett
led in BCE common shares, DSUs, or a combination thereof. 
DSUs 
If compensation is elected to be taken in DSUs, we issue DSUs equal 
to the fair value of the services received, with a corresponding credit 
to contributed surplus. Additional DSUs are issued to reect dividends 
declared on the common shares. DSUs are settled in BCE common shares 
purchased on the open market following the cessation of employment 
or when a director leaves the board. Upon settlement of the DSUs, any 
difference between the cost of shares purchased on the open market 
and the amount credited to contributed surplus is reected in the de˙cit. 
Stock options 
The fair value of options granted is determined using a variation of a 
binomial option pricing model that takes into account factors speci˙c to 
the stock option plan. We recognize compensation expense in 
Operating 
costs
 in the income statements over the three-year vesting period, with 
a corresponding credit to contributed surplus. 
When stock options are exercised, we credit share capital for the amount 
received and the amounts previously credited to contributed surplus. 
E) Income and other taxes 
Current and deferred income tax expense is recognized in the income 
statements, except to the extent that the expense relates to items 
recognized in Other comprehensive (loss) income or direct ly in equity. 
We use the liability method to account for deferred tax assets and 
liabilities, which arise from: 
Ł 
temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and 

liabilities recognized in the statements of ˙nancial position and their 

corresponding tax bases 
Ł 
the carryforward of unused tax losses and credits, to the extent they 
can be used in the future 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply when the asset or liability is recovered or settled. 
Both our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at 
the reporting date.

Deferred taxes are provided on temporary differences arising from 
investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates, except 
where we control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
Tax liabilities are, where permitted, offset against tax assets within the 
same taxable entity and tax jurisdiction. 
Investment tax credits (ITCs), other tax credits
and government grants 
We recognize ITCs, other tax credits and government grants given on 
eligible expenditures when it is reasonably assured that they will be 
realized. We use the cost reduction method to account for ITCs and 
government grants, under which the credits are applied against the 
expense or asset to which the ITCs or government grants relate. 
F) Cash equivalents and other shor t-term deposits 
Cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase and are 
measured at amortized cost . Short-term deposits with original maturities of more than three months are included in 
Short-term investments 
in the 
s
tatements of ˙nancial position and are measured at amortized cost . 
G) Securitization of receivables 
Proceeds on the securitization of receivables are recognized as a collateralized borrowing as we do not transfer control and substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity. 
H) Inventory 
We measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventory includes all costs to purchase, convert and bring the inventories 
to their present location and condition. We determine cost using speci˙c identi˙cation for major equipment held for resale and the weighted 
average cost formula for all other inventory. We maintain inventory valuation reserves for inventory that is slow-moving or potentially obsolete, 
calculated using an inventory aging analysis. 
I) Proper ty, plant and equipment 
We record property, plant and equipment at cost . Cost includes 
expenditures that are attributable directly to the acquisition or 
construction of the asset , including the purchase cost and labour. 
Borrowing costs are capitalized for qualifying assets if the time to build 
or develop the asset is in excess of one year, at a rate that is based 

on the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding long-term 

debt . Gains or losses on the sale or retirement of property, plant and 

equipment are recorded in 
Other expense
 in the income statements. 
Leases 
We enter into leases for network infrastructure and equipment, land 
and buildings in the normal course of business. Lease contracts are 
typically made for ˙xed periods but may include purchase, renewal or 
termination options. Leases are negotiated on an individual basis and 
contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. 
We adopted IFRS˝ˆ Œ Leases as of January˝ˆ, ˜˚ˆˇ. Certain ˙nance 
leases entered into prior to˝˜˚ˆˇ were initially measured under IAS˝ˆ 
Œ 
Leases, as permitted by the transition provisions of IFRS˝ˆ. 
IFRSˆ˝˘ 
We assess whether a contract contains a lease at inception of the 
contract. A lease contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identi˙ed asset for a period in exchange for consideration. We recognize 
lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets for all lease 
agreements, except for short-term leases and leases of low value 
assets, which are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term. Consideration in a contract is allocated to lease and non-lease 
components on a relative stand-alone value basis. We generally account 
for lease components and any associated non-lease components as 
a single lease component . 
Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease 
payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted 
using our incremental borrowing rate, unless the rate implicit in the 
lease is readily determinable. We apply a single incremental borrowing 
rate to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics. Lease payments 
included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise: 
Ł 
˙xed (and in-substance ˙xed) lease payments, less any lease incentives 
Ł 
variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate 
Ł 
payments expected under residual value guarantees and payments 
relating to purchase options and renewal option periods that are 
reasonably certain to be exercised (or periods subject to termination 
options that are not reasonably certain to be exercised) 
Lease liabilities are subsequent ly measured at amortized cost using 
the effective interest method. Lease liabilities are remeasured, with a 
corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use assets, when 
there is a change in variable lease payments arising from a change 
in an index or rate, or when we change our assessment of whether 
purchase, renewal or termination options will be exercised.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost , and are comprised of the 
initial measurement of the corresponding lease liabilities, lease payments 
made at or before the commencement date and any initial direct costs. 
They are subsequently depreciated on a straight-line basis and reduced 
by impairment losses, if any. Right-of-use assets may also be adjusted 
to reect the remeasurement of related lease liabilities. If we obtain 
ownership of the leased asset by the end of the lease term or the cost 
of the right-of-use asset reects the exercise of a purchase option, 
we depreciate the right-of-use asset from the lease commencement 
date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset. Otherwise, 
we depreciate the right-of-use asset from the commencement date 
to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the underlying asset or the 
end of the lease term. 
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are not 
included in the measurement of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. 
The related payments are expensed in 
o
perating costs in the period 
in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs. 
IASˆ˝ 
Prior to ˜˚ˆˇ, under IAS˝ ˆ, leases of property, plant and equipment 
were recognized as ˙nance leases when we obtained substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying assets. At 
the inception of the lease, we recorded an asset together with a 
corresponding long-term lease liability, at the lower of the fair value 

of the leased asset or the present value of the minimum future lease 
payments, excluding non-lease components. 
Asset retirement obligations (AROs) 
We initially measure and record AROs at management™s best estimate 
using a present value methodology, adjusted subsequent ly for any 
changes in the timing or amount of cash ows and changes in discount 
rates. We capitalize asset retirement costs as part of the related assets 
and amortize them into earnings over time. We also increase the ARO 

and record a corresponding amount in interest expense to reect the 
passage of time. 
J) Intangible assets 
Finite-life intangible assets 
Finite-life intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated 
amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Software 
We record internal-use software at cost. Cost includes expenditures 
that are attributable direct ly to the acquisition or development of the 
software, including the purchase cost and labour. 
Software development costs are capitalized when all the following 
conditions are met: 
Ł 
technical feasibility can be demonstrated 
Ł 
management has the intent and the ability to complete the asset for 

use or sale 
Ł 
it is probable that economic bene˙ts will be generated 
Ł 
costs attributable to the asset can be measured reliably 
Customer relationships 
Customer relationship assets are acquired through business acquisitions 
and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. 
Program and feature lm rights 
We account for program and feature ˙lm rights as intangible assets 
when these assets are acquired for the purpose of distribution through 
broadcasting, digital media and streaming services. Program and feature 
˙lm rights, which include producer advances and licence fees paid in 
advance of receipt of the program or ˙lm, are stated at acquisition cost 
less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if 
any. Programs and feature ˙lms under licence agreements are recorded 
as assets for rights acquired and liabilities for obligations incurred when: 
Ł 
we receive a broadcast master and the cost is known or reasonably 

determinable for new program and feature ˙lm licences; or 
Ł 
the licence term commences for licence period extensions or 
syndicated programs 
Related liabilities of programs and feature ˙lms are classi˙ed as 
current or non-current , based on the payment terms. Amortization of 
program and feature ˙lm rights is recorded in 
Operating costs
 in the 
income statements. 
Inde˜nite-life intangible assets 
Brand assets, mainly comprised of the Bell, Bell Media and Bell MTS 
brands, and broadcast licences are acquired through business 
acquisitions and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, 
less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Wireless spectrum licences 
are recorded at acquisition cost , including borrowing costs when the 
time to build or develop the related network is in excess of one year. 
Borrowing costs are calculated at a rate that is based on the weighted 
average interest rate on our outstanding long-term debt . 
Current ly, there are no legal, regulatory, competitive or other factors 
that limit the useful lives of our inde˙nite-life intangible assets. 
K) De preciation and amortization 
We depreciate property, plant and equipment and amortize ˙nite-life 
intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
We review our estimates of useful lives on an annual basis and adjust 
depreciation and amortization on a prospective basis, as required. Land 
and assets under construction or development are not depreciated.

L) Investments in associates and joint arrangements 
Our ˙nancial statements incorporate our share of the results of our 
associates and joint ventures using the equity method of accounting, 
except when the investment is classi˙ed as held for sale. Equity income 
from investments is recorded in 
Other expense
 in the income statements. 
Investments in associates and joint ventures are recognized initially at 
cost and adjusted thereafter to include the company™s share of income 
or loss and comprehensive income or loss on an after-tax basis. 
Investments are reviewed for impairment at each reporting period and 
we compare their recoverable amount to their carrying amount when 
there is an indication of impairment . 
We recognize our share of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of 
joint operations in accordance with the related contractual agreements. 
M) Business acquisitions and goodwill 
Business acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method. 
The consideration transferred in a business acquisition is measured 
at fair value at the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related transaction 
costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in 
Severance, acquisition 
and other costs
 in the income statements. 
Identi˙able assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, of 
acquired businesses are recorded at their fair values at the date of 
acquisition. When we acquire control of a business, any previously-held 
equity interest is remeasured to fair value and any gain or loss on 
remeasurement is recognized in 
Other expense
 in the income statements. 
The excess of the purchase consideration and any previously-held 
equity interest over the fair value of identi˙able net assets acquired 
is recorded as 
 Goodwill
 in the statements of ˙nancial position. If the 
fair value of identi˙able net assets acquired exceeds the purchase 
consideration and any previously-held equity interest , the difference 
is recognized in 
 Other expense
 in the income statements immediately 
as a bargain purchase gain. 
N) Impairment of non-˜nancial assets 
Goodwill and inde˙nite-life intangible assets are tested for impairment 
annually or when there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Property, plant and equipment and ˙nite-life intangible assets are tested 
for impairment if events or changes in circumstances, assessed at 
each reporting period, indicate that their carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets other than 
goodwill are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately 
identi˙able cash inows. 
Impairment losses are recognized and measured as the excess of the 
carrying value of the assets over their recoverable amount. An asset™s 
recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal 
and its value in use. Previously recognized impairment losses, other than 
those attributable to goodwill, are reviewed for possible reversal at each 
reporting date and, if the asset™s recoverable amount has increased, 

all or a portion of the impairment is reversed. 
Goodwill impairment testing 
We perform an annual test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter 
for each of our cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs to 
which goodwill is allocated, and whenever there is an indication that 
goodwill might be impaired. 
A CGU is the smallest identi˙able group of assets that generates cash 
inowsthat 
are independent of the cash inows from other assets or 
groups of assets. 
We identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value 
of a CGU or group of CGUs to its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount of a CGU or group of CGUs is the higher of its fair value less 
costs of disposal and its value in use. Both fair value less costs of disposal 
and value in use are based on estimates of discounted future cash 
ows or other valuation methods. Cash ows are projected based on 
past experience, actual operating results and business plans, including 
any impact from changes in interest rates and ination. When the 
recoverable amount of a CGU or group of CGUs is less than its carrying 
value, the recoverable amount is determined for its identi˙able assets 
and liabilities. The excess of the recoverable amount of the CGU or 
group of CGUs over the total of the amounts assigned to its assets and 
liabilities is the recoverable amount of goodwill. 
An impairment charge is recognized in the income statements for any 
excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its recoverable amount . 
For purposes of impairment testing of goodwill, our CGUs or groups 
of CGUs correspond to our reporting segments as disclosed in Note˝˛, 
Segmented information
. 
O) Financial instruments and contract assets 
We measure trade and other receivables, including wireless device 
˙nancing plan receivables, at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method, net of any allowance for doubtful accounts. 
Our portfolio investments in equity securities are classi˙ed as fair 
value through other comprehensive income and are presented in our 
statements of ˙nancial position as 
Other non-current assets
. These 
securities are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition, including 
related transaction costs, and are adjusted to fair value at each reporting 
date. The corresponding unrealized gains and losses are recorded in 
Other comprehensive (loss) income 
in the consolidated statements of 
comprehensive income (statements of comprehensive income) and are 
reclassi˙ed from 
Accumulated other comprehensive loss
 to the de˙cit 
in the statements of ˙nancial position when realized. 
Other ˙nancial liabilities, which include trade payables and accruals, 
compensation payable, obligations imp
osed by the Canadian Radio-
television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), interest payable 
and long-term debt, are recorded at amortized cost using the effective 
interest method.

We measure the allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of 
contract assets based on an expected credit loss (ECL) model, which 
takes into account current economic conditions, historical information, 
and forward-looking information, including higher interest rates and 
ination. We use the simpli˙ed approach for measuring losses based 
on the lifetime ECL for trade and other receivables and contract assets. 
Amounts considered uncollectible are written off and recognized in 
Operating costs
 in the income statements. 
The cost of issuing debt is included as part of long-term debt and is 
accountedfor 
at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 
The cost of issuing equity is reected in the consolidated statements 
of changes in equity as a charge to the de˙cit . 
P) Derivative ˜nancial instruments 
We use derivative ˙nancial instruments principally to manage risks 
related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates and 
cash ow exposures related to share-based payment plans, capital 
expenditures, long-term debt instruments and operating expenses. We 
do not use derivative ˙nancial instruments for speculative or trading 
purposes. 
Derivatives that mature within one year are included in 
Other current 
assets
 or 
Trade payables and other liabilities
 in the statements of 
˙nancial position, whereas derivatives that have a maturity of more 
than one year are included in 
Other non-current assets
 or 
Other 
non-current liabilities
. 
Hedge accounting 
Fair value hedges 
We use cross currency interest rate swaps to manage foreign currency 
and interest rate risk on certain U.S. dollar long-term debt. We use 
interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk on certain Canadian 
dollar long-term debt. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives 
and the related debt are recognized in 
 Other expense
 in the income 
statements and offset each other, except for any ineffective portion of 
the hedging relationship. 
Cash ow hedges 
We use foreign currency forward contracts and options to manage 
foreign currency risk relating to anticipated purchases denominated 
in foreign currencies. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are 
recognized in our statements of comprehensive income, except for any 
ineffective portion of the hedging relationship, which is recognized in 
Other expense 
in the income statements. Realized gains and losses in 
accumulated other comprehensive loss are reclassi˙ed to the income 
statements or to the initial cost of the related non-˙nancial asset in the 
same periods as the corresponding hedged transactions are recognized. 
We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency 
risk relating to our U.S. dollar debt under our commercial paper program, 
securitization of receivables program and committed credit facilities. 
Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in 
Other 
expense
 in the income statements and offset the foreign currency 
translation adjustment on the related debt, except for any portion of 
the hedging relationship which is ineffective. 
We use cross currency interest rate swaps to manage foreign currency 
and interest rate risk related to certain U.S. dollar long-term debt . We 

also use interest rate swaps, including forward starting interest rate 
swaps, to manage the interest rate risk related to certain Canadian 
dollar long-term debt. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives 
are recognized in our statements of comprehensive income, except for 
amounts recorded in 
Other expense
 in the income statements to offset 
the foreign currency translation adjustment on the related debt and 
any portion of the hedging relationship which is ineffective. 
We use forward starting interest rate swaps to manage interest rate 
risk related to certain future debt issuances. Changes in the fair value 
of these derivatives are recognized in our statements of comprehensive 
income, except for any ineffective portion of the hedging relationship, 
which is recognized in 
Other expense 
in the income statements. 
Realized gains and losses in 
a
ccumulated other comprehensive 
loss 
are reclassi˙ed to 
Interest expense
 in the income statements over the 
term of the related debt. 
Derivatives used as economic hedges 
We use derivatives to manage cash ow exposures related to our equity 
settled share-based payment plans and anticipated purchases in foreign 
currencies, interest rate risk related to preferred share dividend rate 
resets and interest rate risk related to existing and anticipated debt 
issuances. As these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, 
the changes in their fair value are recorded in the income statements 
in 
Other expense
. 
Q) Post-employment bene˜t plans 
De˜ned bene˜t (DB) and other post-employment
bene˜t (OPEB) plans 
We maintain DB pension plans that provide pension bene˙ts for certain 
employees and retirees. Bene˙ts are based on the employee™s length 
of service and average rate of pay during the highest paid consecutive 
˙ve years of service. Most employees are not required to contribute 
to the plans. Certain plans provide cost of living adjustments to help 
protect the income of retired employees against ination. 
We are responsible for adequately funding our DB pension plans. We 
make contributions to them based on various actuarial cost methods 
permitted by pension regulatory bodies. Contributions reect actuarial 
assumptions about future investment returns, salary projections, future 
service and life expectancy. 
We provide OPEBs to some of our employees, including: 
Ł
 
 
health care and life insurance bene˙ts during retirement, which have 
 
been phased out for new retirees since December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚ˆ. Most of 
 
these OPEB plans are unfunded and bene˙ts are paid when incurred. 
Ł
 
 
other bene˙ts, including workers™ compensation and medical bene˙ts 
 
to former or inactive employees, their bene˙ciaries and dependants, 
 
from the time their employment ends until their retirement starts, 
 
under certain circumstances 
ˇ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We accrue our obligations and related costs under post-employment 
bene˙t plans, net of the fair value of the bene˙t plan assets. Pension 
and OPEB costs are determined using: 
Ł 
the projected unit credit method, prorated on years of service, which 
takes into account future pay levels 
Ł 
a discount rate based on market interest rates of high-quality corporate 
˙xed income investments with maturities that match the timing of 

bene˙ts expected to be paid under the plans 
Ł 
management™s best estimate of pay increases, retirement ages of 

employees, expected healthcare costs and life expectancy 
We value post-employment bene˙t plan assets at fair value using 
current market values. 
Post-employment bene˙t plans current service cost is included in 
Operating costs
 in the income statements. Interest on our post-
employment bene˙t plan assets and obligations is recognized in 
Finance costs
 in the income statements and represents the accretion 
of interest on the assets and obligations under our post-employment 
bene˙t plans. The interest rate is based on market conditions that 
existed at the beginning of the year. Actuarial gains and losses for all 
post-employment bene˙t plans are recorded in 
Other comprehensive 
(loss) income
 in the statements of comprehensive income in the period 
in which they occur and are recognized immediately in the de˙cit. 
December˝˛ˆ˝is the measurement date for our signi˙cant post-
employment bene˙t plans. Our actuaries perform a valuation based 
on management™s assumptions at least every three years to determine 
the actuarial present value of the accrued DB pension plans and OPEB 
obligations. The most recent actuarial valuation of our signi˙cant pension 
plans was as at December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˜. 
De˜ned contribution (DC) pension plans 
We maintain DC pension plans that provide certain employees with 
bene˙ts. Under these plans, we are responsible for contributing a 
predetermined amount to an employee™s retirement savings, based 
on a percentage of the employee™s salary. 
We recognize a post-employment bene˙t plans service cost for 
DC˝pension plans when the employee provides service to the company, 
essentially coinciding with our cash contributions. 
When eligible, new employees can only participate in the DC pension 
plans. 
R) Provisions 
Provisions are recognized when all the following conditions are met: 
Ł 
the company has a present legal or constructive obligation based 

on past events 
Ł 
it is probable that an outow of economic resources will be required 

to sett le the obligation 
Ł 
the amount can be reasonably estimated 
S) Estimates and key judgments 
When preparing the ˙nancial statements, management makes estimates 
and judgments relating to: 
Ł 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
Ł 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
Ł 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
We base our estimates on a number of factors, including but not limited 
to historical experience, current events, economic and ˙nancial market 
conditions such as interest rates, ination and the risk of recession, 

geopolitical events and supply chain disruptions, and actions that the 

company may undertake in the future, as well as other assumptions 
that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. A change in 

these assumptions may have an impact on our ˙nancial statements 
including but not limited to impairment testing, fair value determination, 
expected credit losses and discount rates used for the present value of 
cash ows. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject 
to measurement uncertainty and actual results could differ. Our more 
signi˙cant estimates and judgments are described below. 
Provisions are measured at the present value of the estimated 
expenditures expected to sett le the obligation, if the effect of the time 
value of money is material. The present value is determined using 
current market assessments of the discount rate and risks speci˙c to 
the obligation. The obligation increases as a result of the passage of 
time, resulting in interest expense which is recognized in 
Finance costs 
in the income statements. 
Estimates 
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment 
andˆnite-life intangible assets 
Property, plant and equipment represent a signi˙cant proportion of 
our total assets. Changes in technology or our intended use of these 
assets, climate change and our environmental, social and corporate 
governance initiatives as well as changes in business prospects or 
economic and industry factors, may cause the estimated useful lives 
of these assets to change. 
Post-employment benet plans 
The amounts reported in the ˙nancial statements relating to DB pension 
plans and OPEBs are determined using actuarial calculations that are 
based on several assumptions. 
The actuarial valuation uses management™s assumptions for, among 
other things, the discount rate, life expectancy, the rate of compensation 
increase, cost of living indexation rate, trends in healthcare costs and 
expected average remaining years of service of employees. 
The most signi˙cant assumptions used to calculate the net post-
employment bene˙t plans cost are the discount rate and life expectancy. 
The discount rate is based on the yield on long-term, high-quality 
corporate ˙xed income investments, with maturities matching the 
estimated cash ows of the post-employment bene˙t plans. Life 
expectancy is based on publicly available Canadian mortality tables 
and is adjusted for the company™s speci˙c experience.

Revenue from contracts with customers 
We are required to make estimates that affect the amount of revenue 
from contracts with customers, including estimating the stand-alone 
selling prices of products and services. 
Impairment of non-nancial assets 
We make a number of estimates when calculating recoverable amounts 
using discounted future cash ows or other valuation methods to test 
for impairment . These estimates include the assumed growth rates for 
future cash ows, the number of years used in the cash ow model 
and the discount rate. 
Deferred taxes 
The amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities are estimated with 
consideration given to the timing, sources and amounts of future 
taxable income. 
Leases 
The application of IFRS˝ˆ requires us to make estimates that affect the 
measurement of right-of-use assets and liabilities, including determining 
the appropriate discount rate used to measure lease liabilities. Lease 
liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments 
that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using our 
incremental borrowing rate, unless the rate implicit in the lease is 
readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is derived from 
publicly available risk-free interest rates, adjusted for applicable credit 
spreads and lease terms. We apply a single incremental borrowing rate 
to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics. 
Fair value of nancial instruments 
Certain ˙nancial instruments, such as investments in equity securities, 
derivative ˙nancial instruments and certain elements of borrowings, are 
carried in the statements of ˙nancial position at fair value, with changes 
in fair value reected in the income statements and the statements 
of comprehensive income. Fair values are estimated by reference to 
published price quotations or by using other valuation techniques that 
may include inputs that are not based on observable market data, such 
as discounted cash ows and earnings multiples. 
Contingencies 
In the ordinary course of business, we become involved in various 
claims and legal proceedings seeking monetary damages and other 
relief. Pending claims and legal proceedings represent a potential cost 
to our business. We estimate the amount of a loss by analyzing potential 
outcomes and assuming various litigation and settlement strategies, 
based on information that is available at the time. 
Onerous contracts 
A provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the unavoidable 
costs of meeting our obligations under a contract exceed the expected 
bene˙ts to be received under the contract . The provision is measured 
at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating 
the contract and the expected net cost of completing the contract . 
Judgments 
Post-employment benet plans 
The determination of the discount rate used to value our post-
employment bene˙t obligations requires judgment . The rate is set by 
reference to market yields of long-term, high-quality corporate ˙xed 
income investments at the beginning of each ˙scal year. Signi˙cant 
judgment is required when setting the criteria for ˙xed income 
investments to be included in the population from which the yield curve 
is derived. The most signi˙cant criteria considered for the selection of 

investments include the size of the issue and credit quality, along with 
the identi˙cation of out liers, which are excluded. 
Income taxes 
The calculation of income taxes requires judgment in interpreting tax 
rules and regulations. There are transactions and calculations for 
which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our tax ˙lings are 
also subject to audits, the outcome of which could change the amount 
of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
Managementjudgmentisusedtodeterminetheamountsofdeferredtax 
assets and liabilities to be recognized. In particular, judgment is required 
when assessing the timing of the reversal of temporary differences to 
which future income tax rates are applied. 
Leases 
The application of IFRS˝ˆ requires us to make judgments that affect 
the measurement of right-of-use assets and liabilities. A lease contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an identi˙ed asset for a period 
of time in exchange for consideration. At inception of the contract, we 
assess whether the contract contains an identi˙ed asset , whether we 
have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic bene˙ts from 
use of the asset and whether we have the right to direct how and for 
what purpose the asset is used. In determining the lease term, we 
include periods covered by renewal options when we are reasonably 
certain to exercise those options. Similarly, we include periods covered 
by termination options when we are reasonably certain not to exercise 
those options. To assess if we are reasonably certain to exercise an 
option, we consider all facts and circumstances that create an economic 
incentive to exercise renewal options (or not exercise termination 
options).Economicincentivesincludethecostsrelatedto the termination 
of the lease, the signi˙cance of any leasehold improvements and the 
importance of the underlying assets to our operations. 
Revenue from contracts with customers 
The identi˙cation of performance obligations within a contract and 
the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations under long-term 
contracts requires judgment. Additionally, the determination of costs to 
obtain a contract, including the identi˙cation of incremental costs, also 
requires judgment. 
CGUs 
Thedeterminationof CGUsor groupsofCGUsfor thepurposeof 
impairment testing requires judgment . 
Contingencies 
The determination of whether a loss is probable from claims and legal 
proceedings and whether an outow of resources is likely requires 
judgment .

NOTE ˛ 
Se gmented information 
The accounting policies used in our segment reporting are the same as 
those we describe in Note˝˜, 
Material accounting policies
. Our segments 
reect how we manage our business and how we classify our operations 
for planning and measuring performance. Accordingly, we operate 
and manage our segments as strategic business units organized by 
products and services. Segments negotiate sales with each other as if 
they were unrelated parties. 
We measure the performance of each segment based on adjusted 
EBITDA, which is equal to operating revenues less operating costs for 
the segment. Substantially all of our severance, acquisition and other 
costs, depreciation and amortization, ˙nance costs and other (expense) 
income are managed on a corporate basis and, accordingly, are not 
reected in segment results. 
Substantially all of our operations and assets are located in Canada. 
In ˜˚˜˜, we began modifying our internal and external reporting 
processes to align with organizational changes that were made 
to reect an increasing strategic focus on multiproduct sales, the 
continually increasing technological convergence of our wireless and 
wireline telecommunications infrastructure and operations driven by 
the deployment of our Fifth Generation (G) and ˙bre networks, and 
our digital transformation. These factors have made it increasingly 
dif˙cult to distinguish between our wireless and wireline operations 
and resulted in changes in Qˆ˝˜˚˜˛˝to the ˙nancial information that is 

regularly provided to our chief operating decision maker to measure 
performance and allocate resources. 
Effective with our Qˆ˝˜˚˜˛˝results, our previous Bell Wireless and Bell 
Wireline operating segments were combined to form a single reporting 
segment called Bell CTS. Bell Media remains a distinct reportable segment 
and is unaffected. Our results are therefore reported in two segments: 
Bell CTS and Bell Media. As a result of our reporting changes, prior 
periods have been restated for comparative purposes. 
OurBellCTSsegmentprovidesawiderangeofcommunicationproducts 
and services to consumers, businesses and government customers 

across Canada. Wireless products and services include mobile data 
and voice plans and devices and are available nationally. Wireline 
products and services comprise data (including Internet access, 
Internet 
protocol television (
IPTV
)
, cloud-based services and business solutions), 
voice, and other communication services and products, which are 
available to our residential, small and medium-sized business and 
large enterprise customers primarily in Ontario, Québec, the At lantic 
provinces and Manitoba, while satellite TV service and connectivity to 
business customers are available nationally across Canada. In addition, 
this segment includes our wholesale business, which buys and sells local 
telephone, long distance, data and other services from or to resellers 
and other carriers, as well as the results of operations of our national 
consumer electronics retailer, The Source (Bell) Electronics˝Inc. (The 
Source). Subsequent to year end, Bell Canada announced a strategic 
partnership with Best Buy Canada to operate ˆ˝The Source 
consumer 
electronics retail stores in Canada, which will be rebranded as Best 
Buy Express and offer the latest in consumer electronics from Best Buy 
along with exclusive telecommunications services from Bell. In addition, 
Bell will wind down The Source head of˙ce and back of˙ce operations, 
as well as close ˆ˚ The Source stores. 
Our Bell Media segment provides conventional TV, specialty TV, pay TV, 
streaming services, digital media services, radio broadcasting services 
andOOH 
and advanced advertising services to customers nationally 
across Canada.

Impair ment of assets 
˛˝ ˛˙ 
During the fourth quarter of ˜˚˜˛, we recognized $˝million of 
impairment charges for French TV channels within our Bell Media 
segment . The impairment charges were the result of a reduction in 
advertising demand in the industry resulting from economic uncertainties 
and unfavourable impacts to market-based valuation assumptions. 
These charges included $ˆ million allocated to inde˙nite-life intangible 
assets for broadcast licences and brands, and $˝million to ˙nite-life 
intangible assets for program and feature ˙lm rights. The impairment 
was determined by comparing the carrying value of the CGUs to their 
fair value less cost of disposal. We estimated the fair value of the CGUs 
using both discounted cash ows and market-based valuation models, 
which include ˙ve-year cash ow projections derived from business 
plans reviewed by senior management for the period of October˝ˆ,˝˜˚˜˛ 
to December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜, using a discount rate of ˇ.% and a perpetuity 
growth rate of ˚.˚%. After impairments, the carrying value of our 
impacted CGU was $˜˝million. 
There was no impairment of Bell Media goodwill. See Note˝˜˜, 
Goodwill
, 
for further details. 
Additionally in ˜˚˜˛, we recorded impairment charges of $˝million 
related mainly to right-of-use assets for certain of˙ce spaces we 
ceased using as part of our real estate optimization strategy as a result 
of our hybrid work policy.

Impairment testing 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or when there is an indication 
that goodwill might be impaired, by comparing the carrying value of a 
CGU or group of CGUs to its recoverable amount, where the recoverable 
amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. 
Recoverable amount 
The recoverable amount for each of the Bell CTS and Bell Media group 
of CGUs is its value in use. 
The recoverable amount for our groups of CGUs is determined by 
discounting ˙ve-year cash ow projections derived from business plans 
reviewed by senior management. The projections reectmanagement™s 
expectations of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, capital expenditures, working 
capital and operating cash ows, based on past experience and future 
expectations of operating performance, including any impact from 
changes in interest rates and ination. 
Cash ows beyond the ˙ve-year period are extrapolated using 
perpetuity growth rates. None of the perpetuity growth rates exceeds 
thelong-term historicalgrowthrates for the markets in whichwe 
operate. 
The discount rates are applied to the cash ow projections and are 
derived fromtheweightedaveragecostofcapitalforeachgroup 
of˝CGUs. 
The following table shows the key assumptions used to estimate the 
recoverable amounts of our groups of CGUs.

Perpetuity 
growth rate 
Discount 
rate 
Bell CTS 
1.5% 
7.0% 
Bell Media 
0.7% 
10.2% 
We believe that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions 
on which the estimate of recoverable amount of the Bell CTS group 
of CGUs is based would not cause its carrying amount to exceed its 
recoverable amount . 
For the Bell Media group of CGUs, a decrease of (˚.˛%) in the perpetuity 
growth rate or an increase of ˚.˜% in the discount rate would have 
resulted in its recoverable amount being equal to its carrying value.

program, which matures in July˝˜˚˜ unless previously terminated. 
The lenders™ interest in the collection of these receivables ranks ahead

We have provided various credit enhancements in the form of 
overcollateralization and subordination of our retained interests. 
The lenders have no further claim on our other assets if customers do

AROs reect management™s best estimates of expected future costs to restore current leased premises to their original condition prior to lease 
inception. Cash outows associated with our ARO liabilities are generally expected to occur at the restoration dates of the assets to which 
they relate, which are long-term in nature. The timing and extent of restoration work that will be ultimately required for these sites is uncertain.

Post-employment bene˙t plans 
Post-employment bene˜t plans cost 
We provide pension and other bene˙ts for most of our employees. These 
 
include DB pension plans, DC pension plans and OPEBs. 
The interest rate risk is managed using a liability matching approach, 
which reduces the exp
osure of the DB plans to a mismatch between 
investment growth and obligation growth.
We operate our DB and DC pension plans under applicable Canadian 
 
and provincial pension legislation, which prescribes minimum and 
 
maximum DB funding requirements. Plan assets are held in trust , and 
 
the oversight of governance of the plans, including investment decisions, 
 
contributions to DB plans and the selection of the DC plans investment 
 
options offered to plan participants, lies with the Risk and Pension Fund 
 
Committee, a committee of our board of directors. 
The longevity risk is managed using a longevity swap, which reduces 
 
the exp
osure of the DB plans to an increase in life expectancy.

$ˆˇ˝million. As such, the Master Trust Fund no longer has any investment 
in MLSE as at December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˛. 
The Bell Canada Pension Plan has an investment arrangement which 
hedges part of its exp
osure to potential increases in longevity, which 
covers approximately $˛˝billion of post-employment bene˙t obligations. 
The fair value of the arrangement is included within other alternative 
investments. 
Cash ows 
We are responsible for adequately funding our DB pension plans. We 
make contributions to them based on various actuarial cost methods 
that are permitted by pension regulatory authorities. Contributions 
reect actuarial assumptions about future investment returns, salary 
projections and future service bene˙ts. Changes in these factors could 
cause actual future contributions to differ from our current estimates 
and could require us to increase contributions to our post-employment 
bene˙t plans in the future, which could have a negative effect on our 
liquidity and ˙nancial performance. 
We contribute to the DC pension plans as employees provide service. 
The following table shows the amounts we contributed to the DB and DC pension plans and the payments made to bene˙ciaries under OPEB plans.

Fina ncial and capital management 
Financial management 
Management™s objectives are to protect BCE and its subsidiaries on a 
consolidated basis against material economic exposures and variability 
of results from various ˙nancial risks, including credit risk, liquidity risk, 
foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk. 
Derivatives 
We use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to foreign 
currency risk, interest rate risk and changes in the price of BCE common 
shares. 
Fair value 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
at the measurement date. 
Certain fair value estimates are affected by assumptions we make about 
the amount and timing of future cash ows and discount rates, all of 
which reect varying degrees of risk. Income taxes and other expenses 
that may be incurred on disposition of ˙nancial instruments are not 
reected in the fair values. As a result , the fair values may not be the 
net amounts that would be realized if these instruments were sett led. 
The carrying values of our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, 
trade and other receivables, trade payables and other liabilities, interest 
payable, dividends payable, notes payable and loans secured by 
receivables approximate fair value as they are short-term. The carrying 
value of wireless device ˙nancing plan receivables approximates 
fair value given that their average remaining duration is short and 
the carrying value is reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts 
and an allowance for revenue adjustments. The carrying value of the 
Bell Mobility trade loans approximates fair value given their average 
remaining duration is short and they bear interest at a variable rate.

Credit risk 
We are exposed to credit risk from operating activities and certain 
 
˙nancing activities, the maximum exposure of which is represented by 
 
the carrying amounts reported in the statements of ˙nancial position. 
We are exposed to credit risk if counterparties to our trade receivables, 
 
including wireless device ˙nancing plan receivables, and derivative 
 
instruments are unable to meet their obligations. The concentration of 
 
credit risk from our customers is minimized because we have a large 
 
and diverse customer base. There was minimal credit risk relating to 
deriv
ative instruments at December˝˛ˆ,˝˜˚˜˛ and ˜˚˜˜. We deal with 
institutions that have investment-grade credit ratings and we expect 
that they will be able to meet their obligations. We regularly monitor
 
our credit risk and credit exposure, and consider, among other factors, 
 
the effects of changes in interest rates and ination.

Our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, amounts available under our securitized receivables program, cash ows from operations 
and possible capital markets ˙nancing are expected to be suf˙cient to fund our operations and ful˙ll our obligations as they become due. Should

Currency exposures 
In ˜˚˜˛, we entered into cross currency interest rate swaps with a 
notional amount of $˛˚˝million in U.S. dollars ($ˇˆ˝million in Canadian 
dollars) to hedge the U.S. currency exposure of outstanding loans 
maturing in˝˜˚˜ under our Bell Mobility trade loan agreement. The fair

Capital management 
We have various capital policies, procedures and processes which 
are utilized to seek to achieve our objectives for capital management . 
These include optimizing our cost of capital and maximizing shareholder 
return while balancing the interests of our stakeholders. 
Our de˙nition of capital includes equity attributable to BCE shareholders, 
debt , cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
In ˜˚˜˛ and ˜˚˜˜, the key ratios that we use
d
 to monitor and manage 
our capital structure 
were 
a net debt leverage ratio 
 
(1) 
Our net debt leverage ratio represents net debt divided by adjusted EBITDA. We de˜ne net debt as debt due within one year plus long-term debt and ˝% of preferred shares, less cash, 
cash equivalents and short-term investments, as shown in our statements of ˜nancial position. For the purposes of calculating our net debt leverage ratio, adjusted EBITDA is twelve-month 
trailing adjusted EBITDA. 
and an adjusted 
EBITDA to adjusted net interest expense ratio 
(2) 
Our adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net interest expense ratio represents adjusted EBITDA divided by adjusted net interest expense. We de˜ne adjusted net interest expense as twelve-month 
trailing net interest expense as shown in our statements of cash ˙ows plus ˝% of twelve-month trailing net earnings attributable to preferred shareholders as shown in our income 
statements. For the purposes of calculating our adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net interest expense ratio, adjusted EBITDA is twelve-month trailing adjusted EBITDA. 
. In˝˜˚˜˛ and ˜˚˜˜, our 
net debt leverage ratio target range was ˜.˚˝to ˜.˝times adjusted 
EBITDA and our adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net interest expense 
ratio target was greater than .˝times. At December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˛, we had 
exceeded the limit of our internal net debt leverage ratio target range 
by ˚.ˇ˝ andexceededour adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net interest 
expense ratio target by ˚.. Going forward, our objective is to see our 
net debt leverage ratio decline over time to be in the range of ˛.˚˝times 
adjusted EBITDA. While current ly in excess of this level, our net debt 
leverage ratio is still consistent with a strong balance sheet, ample 
˙nancial exibility and investment grade credit ratings. Additionally, 
given the correlation between adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net interest 
expense ratio and the net debt leverage ratio, we are simplifying our 
internal targets to reect the net debt leverage ratio only and will not 
report against adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net interest expense in the 
future. We believe that this ratio is of less relative importance to our 
investors, lenders and other stakeholders as a measure of the strength 
of our capital structure. 
˜ ˝˛ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
We believe that certain investors and analysts use our net debt leverage 
ratio as a measure of ˙nancial leverage and health of the company.

Description of the plans 
ESP 
The ESP is designed to encourage employees of BCE and its participating 
subsidiaries to own shares of BCE. Employees can choose to have up to 
ˆ˜% of their eligible annual earnings withheld through regular payroll 
deductions for the purchase of BCE common shares. In some cases, 
the employer also contributes up to ˜% of the employee™s eligible 
annual earnings to the plan. Dividends are credited to the participant™s 
account on each dividend payment date and are equivalent in value to 
the dividends paid on BCE common shares. Employer contributions to 
the ESP and related dividends are subject to employees holding their 
shares for a two-year vesting period. 
The trustee of the ESP buys BCE common shares for the participants on 
the open market, by private purchase or from treasury. BCE determines 
the method the trustee uses to buy the shares. 
At December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˛, ,˛˚,˚˝common shares were authorized for 
issuance from treasury under the ESP. At December˝˛ˆ,˝˜˚˜˛ and ˜˚˜˜, 
there were ˆ,˚,ˆ˛ and ˆ,˚˜,ˆˆ˝unvested employer ESP contributions, 
respectively. 
RSUs/PSUs 
RSUs/PSUs are granted to executives and other eligible employees. 
Dividends in the form of additional RSUs/PSUs are credited to the 
participant™s account on each dividend payment date and are equivalent 
in value to the dividends paid on BCE common shares. Executives and 
other eligible employees are granted a speci˙c number of RSUs/PSUs 
for a given performance period based mainly on their level and position. 
RSUs/PSUs vest fully after three years of continuous employment from 
the date of grant and if performance objectives are met for certain 
PSUs, as determined by the board of directors. 
The following table summarizes RSUs/PSUs outstanding at December˝˛ˆ,˝˜˚˜˛ and ˜˚˜˜.

DSUs 
Eligible bonuses and RSUs may be paid in the form of DSUs when 
executives or other eligible employees elect or are required to participate 
in the plan. The value of a DSU at the issuance date is equal to the value of 
one BCE common share. For non-management directors, compensation 
is paid in DSUs until the minimum share ownership requirement is met; 
thereafter, at least ˚% of their compensation is paid in DSUs. There 
are no vesting requirements relating to DSUs. Dividends in the form 
of additional DSUs are credited to the participant™s account on each 
dividend payment date and are equivalent in value to the dividends 
paid on BCE common shares. DSUs are settled when the holder leaves 
the company. 
At December ˛ˆ,˝˜˚˜˛ and ˜˚˜˜, there were ˛,˛,ˆ˜˝and ˛,˛˜ˆ,ˆ˝DSUs 
outstanding, respectively. 
Stock options 
Under BCE™s long-term incentive plans, BCE may grant options to 
executives to buy BCE common shares. The subscription price of a 
grant is based on the higher of: 
Ł 
the volume-weighted average of the trading price on the trading day 
immediately prior to the effective date of the grant 
Ł 
the volume-weighted average of the trading price for the last ˙ve 
consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately 
prior to the effective date of the grant 
At December˝˛ˆ, ˜˚˜˛, in addition to the stock options outstanding, 
,ˇ,˚ˆ˝common shares were authorized for issuance under these 
plans. Options vest fully after three years of continuous employment 
from the date of grant. All options become exercisable when they vest 
and can be exercised for a period of seven years from the date of grant 
for options granted prior to˝˜˚ˆˇ and ten years from the date of grant 
for options granted since ˜˚ˆˇ.

When estimating minimum transaction prices allocated to the remaining unful˙lled, or partially unful˙lled, performance obligations, BCE applied 
the practical expedient to not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have an original expected duration of one

Our commitments for property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets include program and feature ˙lm rights and investments to 
expand and update our networks to meet customer demand. 
Purchase obligations consist of contractual obligations under service 
and product contracts for operating expenditures and other purchase 
obligations. 
Our commitments for leases not yet commenced include real estate, 
OOH advertising spaces and ˙bre use. These leases are non-cancellable. 
On October˝˜˛, ˜˚˜˛, Bell Media announced it plans to acquire the 
Canadian OOH 
media business of OUTFRONT Media˝Inc. The transaction 
is valued at $ˆ˚˝million, subject to certain adjustments, and is expected 
to close in the ˙rst half of ˜˚˜, subject to regulatory approval and 
other closing conditions. The acquisition of the Canadian 
 OOHmedia 
business of OUTFRONT Media˝Inc. is expected to support Bell Media™s 
digital media strategy and to deliver impactful, multi-channel marketing 
solutions coast-to-coast . The results of the Canadian 
OOH business 
of OUTFRONT Media˝Inc. will be included in our Bell Media segment . 
Contingencies 
As part of its ongoing review of wholesale Internet rates, on October˝, 
˜˚ˆ, the CRTC signi˙cant ly reduced, on an interim basis, some of the 
wholesale rates that Bell Canada and other major providers charge 
for access by third-party Internet resellers to ˙bre-to-the-node (FTTN) 
or cable networks, as applicable. On August˝ˆ, ˜˚ˆˇ, the CRTC further 
reduced the wholesale rates that Internet resellers pay to access network 
infrastructure built by facilities-based providers like Bell Canada, with 
retroactive effect back to March˝˜˚ˆ. 
The August ˜˚ˆˇ decision was stayed, ˙rst by the Federal Court of 
Appeal and then by the CRTC, with the result that it never came into 
effect . In response to review and vary applications ˙led by each of 
Bell Canada, ˙ve major cable carriers (Cogeco Communications˝Inc., 
Bragg Communications˝Inc. (Eastlink), Rogers Communications 
Canada˝Inc., Shaw Communications˝Inc. and Videotron Ltée) and Telus 
Communications˝Inc., the CRTC issued Decision ˜˚˜ˆ-ˆ˜˝on May˝˜, 
˜˚˜ˆ, which mostly reinstated the rates prevailing prior to August ˜˚ˆˇ 
with some reductions to the Bell Canada rates with retroactive effect to 
March˝˜˚ˆ. As a result, in Q˜˝˜˚˜ˆ, we recorded a reduction in revenue 
of $˝million in our income statement
s. 
While there remains a requirement to refund monies to third-party 
Internet resellers, the establishment of ˙nal wholesale rates that 
are similar to those prevailing since˝˜˚ˆˇ reduces the impact of the 
CRTC™s long-running review of wholesale Internet rates. The largest 
reseller, TekSavvy Solutions˝Inc. (TekSavvy), obtained leave to appeal 
the CRTC™s decision of May˝˜,˝˜˚˜ˆ before the Federal Court of Appeal. 
Oral hearings are now complete and we are awaiting a decision of 
the court . The decision was also challenged in three petitions brought 
by TekSavvy, the Canadian Network Operators Consortium˝Inc. and 
National Capital Freenet before Cabinet, but on May˝˜, ˜˚˜˜, Cabinet 
announced it would not alter the decision. 
In the ordinary course of business, we become involved in various claims 
and legal proceedings seeking monetary damages and other relief. In 
particular, because of the nature of our consumer-facing business, we 
are exposed to class actions pursuant to which substantial monetary 
damages may be claimed. Due to the inherent risks and uncertainties 
of the litigation process, we cannot predict the ˙nal outcome or timing 
of claims and legal proceedings. Subject to the foregoing, and based on 
information currently available and management™s assessment of the 
merits of the claims and legal proceedings pending at March˝, ˜˚˜, 
management believes that the ultimate resolution of these claims and 
legal proceedings is unlikely to have a material and negative effect on 
our ˙nancial statements. We believe that we have strong defences and 
we intend to vigorously defend our positions.

Tax aspects

gains they realize, if any, when they sell their shares or are deemed to have 
sold them. 
The sale or disposition of your shares

could trigger a capital gain 
IMPORTANT: If you received Nortel Networks common shares in May˚˛˝˝˝ 
and/or Bell Aliant Regional Communications Income Fund units in July˚˛˝˝,

. 
Dividends 
Since January˝ˆ,˝˜˚˚ and unless stated otherwise, dividends paid by BCE˝Inc. to 
Canadian residents are eligible dividends as per the 
Canadian Income Tax Act
. Since 
March˝˜,˝˜˚˚ and unless stated otherwise, dividends paid by BCE˝Inc. to Québec 
residents also qualify as eligible dividends. 
Non-residents of Canada 
Dividends paid or credited to non-residents of Canada are subject to a ˜% withholding 
tax unless reduced by a tax treaty. Under current tax treaties, U.S. and U.K. residents 
are subject to a ˆ% withholding tax. 
Beginning in ˜˚ˆ˜, the Canada Revenue Agency introduced new rules requiring 
residents of any country with which Canada has a tax treaty to certify that they 
reside in that country and are eligible to have Canadian non-resident tax withheld 
on the payment of their dividends at the tax treaty rate. Registered shareholders 
should have completed the Declaration of Eligibility for Bene˙ts under a Tax Treaty 
for a Non-Resident Taxpayer and returned it to the transfer agent . 
U.S. Residents 
In addition to the Declaration of Eligibility for Bene˙ts under a Tax Treaty for a 
Non-Resident Taxpayer mentioned above, we are required to solicit taxpayer 
identi˙cation numbers and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form W-ˇ˝certi˙cations 
of residency from certain U.S. residents. If these have not been received, we may be 
required to deduct the IRS™s speci˙ed backup withholding tax. For more information, 
please contact the transfer agent or the Investor Relations group.

Shareholder services 
Dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan (DRP) 
A convenient method for eligible shareholders to reinvest their dividends and 
make optional cash contributions to purchase additional common shares without 
brokerage˝costs. 
Dividend direct deposit service 
Avoid postal delays and trips to the bank by subscribing to the dividend direct 
deposit˝service. 
Direct registration (DRS) 
Holding your shares electronically in lieu of shareˆcerticates 
Holdings are represented by a statement issued when establishing or subsequently 
modifying your DRS balance. This option removes the risks of holding share 
certi˙cates, including their safekeeping, and most important ly, eases the replacement 
process. Note that there is a cost to replace lost or stolen certi˙cates as well as 
certi˙cates mailed and never received by the shareholder (if claimed later than 
one year after mailing). Generally, this cost is a percentage of the value of the 
shares represented. 
E-delivery service 
Enrol in the e-delivery service to receive the proxy material, the annual ˙nancial˝report 
and/or quarterly reports by e-mail. By doing so, you will receive your documents 
faster and in an environmentally friendly manner while helping your company 
reduce its costs. 
Duplicate mailings 
Eliminate duplicate mailings by consolidating your accounts. 
Manage your shareholder account 
Enrol in 
Investor Central
 at 
tsxtrust .com/issuer-investor-login
 and bene˙t from 
a˝
wide variety of self-service tools to help track and manage your shares. 
For further details on any of these services, registered shareholders (shares are 
registered under your name) must contact the transfer agent. Non-registered 
shareholders must contact their brokers.
